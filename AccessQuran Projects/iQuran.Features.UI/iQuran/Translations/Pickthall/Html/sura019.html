<P><A NAME="019_001"><span class=textnos>1</span><br>
Kaf. Ha. Ya. A'in. Sad. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_002"><span class=textnos>2</span><br>
A mention of the mercy of thy Lord unto His servant Zachariah. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_003"><span class=textnos>3</span><br>
When he cried unto his Lord a cry in secret, </P>
<P><A NAME="019_004"><span class=textnos>4</span><br>
Saying: My Lord! Lo! the bones of me wax feeble and my head is shining  with grey hair, and I have never been unblest in prayer to Thee, my Lord. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_005"><span class=textnos>5</span><br>
Lo! I fear my kinsfolk after me, since my wife is barren. Oh, give me from  Thy presence a successor </P>
<P><A NAME="019_006"><span class=textnos>6</span><br>
Who shall inherit of me and inherit (also) of the house of Jacob. And make  him, my Lord, acceptable (unto Thee). </P>
<P><A NAME="019_007"><span class=textnos>7</span><br>
(It was said unto him): O Zachariah! Lo! We bring thee tidings of a son  whose name is John; we have given the same name to none before (him). </P>
<P><A NAME="019_008"><span class=textnos>8</span><br>
He said: My Lord! How can I have a son when my wife is barren and I have  reached infirm old age ? </P>
<P><A NAME="019_009"><span class=textnos>9</span><br>
He said: So (it will be). Thy Lord saith: It is easy for Me, even as I created  thee before, when thou wast naught. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_010"><span class=textnos>10</span><br>
He said: My Lord! Appoint for me some token. He said: Thy token is that  thou, with no bodily defect, shalt not speak unto mankind three nights. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_011"><span class=textnos>11</span><br>
Then he came forth unto his people from the sanctuary, and signified to  them: Glorify your Lord at break of day and fall of night. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_012"><span class=textnos>12</span><br>
(And it was said unto his son): O John! Hold fast the Scripture. And we gave  him wisdom when a child, </P>
<P><A NAME="019_013"><span class=textnos>13</span><br>
And compassion from Our presence, and purity; and he was devout, </P>
<P><A NAME="019_014"><span class=textnos>14</span><br>
And dutiful toward his parents. And he was not arrogant, rebellious. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_015"><span class=textnos>15</span><br>
Peace on him the day he was born, and the day he dieth and the day he shall  be raised alive! </P>
<P><A NAME="019_016"><span class=textnos>16</span><br>
And make mention of Mary in the Scripture, when she had withdrawn from  her people to a chamber looking East, </P>
<P><A NAME="019_017"><span class=textnos>17</span><br>
And had chosen seclusion from them. Then We sent unto her Our Spirit and  it assumed for her the likeness of a perfect man. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_018"><span class=textnos>18</span><br>
She said: Lo! I seek refuge in the Beneficent One from thee, if thou art God- fearing. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_019"><span class=textnos>19</span><br>
He said: I am only a messenger of thy Lord, that I may bestow on thee a  faultless son. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_020"><span class=textnos>20</span><br>
She said: How can I have a son when no mortal hath touched me, neither  have I been unchaste ? </P>
<P><A NAME="019_021"><span class=textnos>21</span><br>
He said: So (it will be). Thy Lord saith: It is easy for Me. And (it will be)  that We may make of him a revelation for mankind and a mercy from Us, and it is a  thing ordained. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_022"><span class=textnos>22</span><br>
And she conceived him, and she withdrew with him to a far place. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_023"><span class=textnos>23</span><br>
And the pangs of childbirth drove her unto the trunk of the palm-tree. She  said: Oh, would that I had died ere this and had become a thing of naught, forgotten! </P>
<P><A NAME="019_024"><span class=textnos>24</span><br>
Then (one) cried unto her from below her, saying: Grieve not! Thy Lord hath  placed a rivulet beneath thee, </P>
<P><A NAME="019_025"><span class=textnos>25</span><br>
And shake the trunk of the palm-tree toward thee, thou wilt cause ripe dates  to fall upon thee. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_026"><span class=textnos>26</span><br>
So eat and drink and be consoled. And if thou meetest any mortal, say: Lo! I  have vowed a fast unto the Beneficent, and may not speak this day to any mortal. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_027"><span class=textnos>27</span><br>
Then she brought him to her own folk, carrying him. They said: O Mary!  Thou hast come with an amazing thing. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_028"><span class=textnos>28</span><br>
O sister of Aaron! Thy father was not a wicked man nor was thy mother a  harlot. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_029"><span class=textnos>29</span><br>
Then she pointed to him. They said: How can we talk to one who is in the  cradle, a young boy ? </P>
<P><A NAME="019_030"><span class=textnos>30</span><br>
He spake: Lo! I am the slave of Allah. He hath given me the Scripture and  hath appointed me a Prophet, </P>
<P><A NAME="019_031"><span class=textnos>31</span><br>
And hath made me blessed wheresoever I may be, and hath enjoined upon  me prayer and almsgiving so long as I remain alive, </P>
<P><A NAME="019_032"><span class=textnos>32</span><br>
And (hath made me) dutiful toward her who bore me, and hath not made me  arrogant, unblest. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_033"><span class=textnos>33</span><br>
Peace on me the day I was born, and the day I die, and the day I shall be  raised alive! </P>
<P><A NAME="019_034"><span class=textnos>34</span><br>
Such was Jesus, son of Mary: (this is) a statement of the truth concerning  which they doubt. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_035"><span class=textnos>35</span><br>
It befitteth not (the Majesty of) Allah that He should take unto Himself a son.  Glory be to Him! When He decreeth a thing, He saith unto it only: Be! and it is. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_036"><span class=textnos>36</span><br>
And lo! Allah is my Lord and your Lord. So serve Him. That is the right  path. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_037"><span class=textnos>37</span><br>
The sects among them differ: but woe unto the disbelievers from the meeting  of an awful Day. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_038"><span class=textnos>38</span><br>
See and hear them on the Day they come unto Us! yet the evil-doers are to- day in error manifest. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_039"><span class=textnos>39</span><br>
And warn them of the Day of anguish when the case hath been decided. Now  they are in a state of carelessness, and they believe not. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_040"><span class=textnos>40</span><br>
Lo! We, only We, inherit the earth and all who are thereon, and unto Us they  are returned. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_041"><span class=textnos>41</span><br>
And make mention (O Muhammad) in the Scripture of Abraham. Lo! he was  a saint, a prophet. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_042"><span class=textnos>42</span><br>
When he said unto his father: O my father! Why worshippest thou that which  heareth not nor seeth, nor can in aught avail thee ? </P>
<P><A NAME="019_043"><span class=textnos>43</span><br>
O my father! Lo! there hath come unto me of knowledge that which came  not unto thee. So follow me, and I will lead thee on a right path. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_044"><span class=textnos>44</span><br>
O my father! Serve not the devil. Lo! the devil is a rebel unto the Beneficent. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_045"><span class=textnos>45</span><br>
O my father! Lo! I fear lest a punishment from the Beneficent overtake thee  so that thou become a comrade of the devil. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_046"><span class=textnos>46</span><br>
He said: Rejectest thou my gods, O Abraham ? If thou cease not, I shall  surely stone thee. Depart from me a long while! </P>
<P><A NAME="019_047"><span class=textnos>47</span><br>
He said: Peace be unto thee! I shall ask forgiveness of my Lord for thee. Lo!  He was ever gracious unto me. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_048"><span class=textnos>48</span><br>
I shall withdraw from you and that unto which ye pray beside Allah, and I  shall pray unto my Lord. It may be that, in prayer unto my Lord, I shall not be  unblest. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_049"><span class=textnos>49</span><br>
So, when he had withdrawn from them and that which they were  worshipping beside Allah, We gave him Isaac and Jacob. Each of them We made a  prophet. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_050"><span class=textnos>50</span><br>
And we gave them of Our mercy, and assigned to them a high and true  renown. </P>

<!--#include virtual="/table_middle.txt"-->


<P><A NAME="019_051"><span class=textnos>51</span><br>
And make mention in the Scripture of Moses. Lo! he was chosen, and he was  a messenger (of Allah), a prophet. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_052"><span class=textnos>52</span><br>
We called him from the right slope of the Mount, and brought him nigh in  communion. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_053"><span class=textnos>53</span><br>
And We bestowed upon him of Our mercy his brother Aaron, a prophet  (likewise). </P>
<P><A NAME="019_054"><span class=textnos>54</span><br>
And make mention in the Scripture of Ishmael. Lo! he was a keeper of his  promise, and he was a messenger (of Allah), a prophet. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_055"><span class=textnos>55</span><br>
He enjoined upon his people worship and almsgiving, and was acceptable in  the sight of his Lord. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_056"><span class=textnos>56</span><br>
And make mention in the Scripture of Idris. Lo! he was a saint, a prophet; </P>
<P><A NAME="019_057"><span class=textnos>57</span><br>
And We raised him to high station. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_058"><span class=textnos>58</span><br>
These are they unto whom Allah showed favour from among the prophets, of  the seed of Adam and of those whom We carried (in the ship) with Noah, and of the  seed of Abraham and Israel, and from among those whom We guided and chose.  When the revelations of the Beneficent were recited unto them, they fell down,  adoring and weeping. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_059"><span class=textnos>59</span><br>
Now there hath succeeded them a later generation whom have ruined  worship and have followed lusts. But they will meet deception. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_060"><span class=textnos>60</span><br>
Save him who shall repent and believe and do right. Such will enter the  Garden, and they will not be wronged in aught - </P>
<P><A NAME="019_061"><span class=textnos>61</span><br>
Gardens of Eden, which the Beneficent hath promised to His slaves in the  unseen. Lo! His promise is ever sure of fulfilment - </P>
<P><A NAME="019_062"><span class=textnos>62</span><br>
They hear therein no idle talk, but only Peace; and therein they have food for  morn and evening. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_063"><span class=textnos>63</span><br>
Such is the Garden which We cause the devout among Our bondmen to  inherit. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_064"><span class=textnos>64</span><br>
We (angels) come not down save by commandment of thy Lord. Unto Him  belongeth all that is before us and all that is behind us and all that is between those  two, and thy Lord was never forgetful - </P>
<P><A NAME="019_065"><span class=textnos>65</span><br>
Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them! Therefor,  worship thou Him and be thou steadfast in His service. Knowest thou one that can be  named along with Him ? </P>
<P><A NAME="019_066"><span class=textnos>66</span><br>
And man saith: When I am dead, shall I forsooth be brought forth alive ? </P>
<P><A NAME="019_067"><span class=textnos>67</span><br>
Doth not man remember that We created him before, when he was naught ? </P>
<P><A NAME="019_068"><span class=textnos>68</span><br>
And, by thy Lord, verily We shall assemble them and the devils, then We  shall bring them, crouching, around hell. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_069"><span class=textnos>69</span><br>
Then We shall pluck out from every sect whichever of them was most  stubborn in rebellion to the Beneficent. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_070"><span class=textnos>70</span><br>
And surely We are Best Aware of those most worthy to be burned therein. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_071"><span class=textnos>71</span><br>
There is not one of you but shall approach it. That is a fixed ordinance of thy  Lord. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_072"><span class=textnos>72</span><br>
Then We shall rescue those who kept from evil, and leave the evil-doers  crouching there. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_073"><span class=textnos>73</span><br>
And when Our clear revelations are recited unto them, those who disbelieve  say unto those who believe: Which of the two parties (yours or ours) is better in  position, and more imposing as an army ? </P>
<P><A NAME="019_074"><span class=textnos>74</span><br>
How many a generation have We destroyed before them, who were more  imposing in respect of gear and outward seeming! </P>
<P><A NAME="019_075"><span class=textnos>75</span><br>
Say: As for him who is in error, the Beneficent will verily prolong his span  of life until, when they behold that which they were promised, whether it be  punishment (in the world), or the Hour (of doom), they will know who is worse in  position and who is weaker as an army. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_076"><span class=textnos>76</span><br>
Allah increaseth in right guidance those who walk aright, and the good deeds  which endure are better in thy Lord's sight for reward, and better for resort. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_077"><span class=textnos>77</span><br>
Hast thou seen him who disbelieveth in Our revelations and saith: Assuredly  I shall be given wealth and children ? </P>
<P><A NAME="019_078"><span class=textnos>78</span><br>
Hath he perused the Unseen, or hath he made a pact with the Beneficent ? </P>
<P><A NAME="019_079"><span class=textnos>79</span><br>
Nay, but We shall record that which he saith and prolong for him a span of  torment. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_080"><span class=textnos>80</span><br>
And We shall inherit from him that whereof he spake, and he will come unto  Us, alone (without his wealth and children). </P>
<P><A NAME="019_081"><span class=textnos>81</span><br>
And they have chosen (other) gods beside Allah that they may be a power for  them. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_082"><span class=textnos>82</span><br>
Nay, but they will deny their worship of them, and become opponents unto  them. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_083"><span class=textnos>83</span><br>
Seest thou not that We have set the devils on the disbelievers to confound  them with confusion ? </P>
<P><A NAME="019_084"><span class=textnos>84</span><br>
So make no haste against them (O Muhammad). We do but number unto  them a sum (of days). </P>
<P><A NAME="019_085"><span class=textnos>85</span><br>
On the day when We shall gather the righteous unto the Beneficent, a goodly  company. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_086"><span class=textnos>86</span><br>
And drive the guilty unto hell, a weary herd, </P>
<P><A NAME="019_087"><span class=textnos>87</span><br>
They will have no power of intercession, save him who hath made a  covenant with his Lord. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_088"><span class=textnos>88</span><br>
And they say: The Beneficent hath taken unto Himself a son. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_089"><span class=textnos>89</span><br>
Assuredly ye utter a disastrous thing </P>
<P><A NAME="019_090"><span class=textnos>90</span><br>
Whereby almost the heavens are torn, and the earth is split asunder and the  mountains fall in ruins, </P>
<P><A NAME="019_091"><span class=textnos>91</span><br>
That ye ascribe unto the Beneficent a son, </P>
<P><A NAME="019_092"><span class=textnos>92</span><br>
When it is not meet for (the Majesty of) the Beneficent that He should  choose a son. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_093"><span class=textnos>93</span><br>
There is none in the heavens and the earth but cometh unto the Beneficent as  a slave. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_094"><span class=textnos>94</span><br>
Verily He knoweth them and numbereth them with (right) numbering. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_095"><span class=textnos>95</span><br>
And each one of them will come unto Him on the Day of Resurrection,  alone. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_096"><span class=textnos>96</span><br>
Lo! those who believe and do good works, the Beneficent will appoint for  them love. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_097"><span class=textnos>97</span><br>
And We make (this Scripture) easy in thy tongue, (O Muhammad) only that  thou mayst bear good tidings therewith unto those who ward off (evil), and warn  therewith the froward folk. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_098"><span class=textnos>98</span><br>
And how many a generation before them have We destroyed! Canst thou  (Muhammad) see a single man of them, or hear from them the slightest sound ?
