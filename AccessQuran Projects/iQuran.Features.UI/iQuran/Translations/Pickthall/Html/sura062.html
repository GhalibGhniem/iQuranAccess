<P><A NAME="062_001"><span class=textnos>1</span><br>
All that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth glorifieth Allah, the  Sovereign Lord, the Holy One, the Mighty, the Wise. </P>
<P><A NAME="062_002"><span class=textnos>2</span><br>
He it is Who hath sent among the unlettered ones a messenger of their own,  to recite unto them His revelations and to make them grow, and to teach them the  Scripture and wisdom, though heretofore they were indeed in error manifest, </P>
<P><A NAME="062_003"><span class=textnos>3</span><br>
Along with others of them who have not yet joined them. He is the Mighty,  the Wise. </P>
<P><A NAME="062_004"><span class=textnos>4</span><br>
That is the bounty of Allah; which He giveth unto whom He will. Allah is of  Infinite Bounty. </P>
<P><A NAME="062_005"><span class=textnos>5</span><br>
The likeness of those who are entrusted with the Law of Moses, yet apply it  not, is as the likeness of the ass carrying books. Wretched is the likeness of folk who  deny the revelations of Allah. And Allah guideth not wrongdoing folk. </P>
<P><A NAME="062_006"><span class=textnos>6</span><br>
Say (O Muhammad): O ye who are Jews! If ye claim that ye are favoured of  Allah apart from (all) mankind, then long for death if ye are truthful. </P>
<P><A NAME="062_007"><span class=textnos>7</span><br>
But they will never long for it because of all that their own hands have sent  before, and Allah is Aware of evil-doers. </P>
<P><A NAME="062_008"><span class=textnos>8</span><br>
Say (unto them, O Muhammad): Lo! the death from which ye shrink will  surely meet you, and afterward ye will be returned unto the Knower of the Invisible  and the Visible, and He will tell you what ye used to do. </P>
<P><A NAME="062_009"><span class=textnos>9</span><br>
O ye who believe! When the call is heard for the prayer of the day of  congregation, haste unto remembrance of Allah and leave your trading. That is better  for you if ye did but know. </P>
<P><A NAME="062_010"><span class=textnos>10</span><br>
And when the prayer is ended, then disperse in the land and seek of Allah's  bounty, and remember Allah much, that ye may be successful. </P>
<P><A NAME="062_011"><span class=textnos>11</span><br>
But when they spy some merchandise or pastime they break away to it and  leave thee standing. Say: That which Allah hath is better than pastime and than  merchandise, and Allah is the Best of providers. 
</P>
