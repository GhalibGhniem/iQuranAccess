<P><A NAME="037_001"><span class=textnos>1</span><br>
By those who set the ranks in battle order </P>
<P><A NAME="037_002"><span class=textnos>2</span><br>
And those who drive away (the wicked) with reproof </P>
<P><A NAME="037_003"><span class=textnos>3</span><br>
And those who read (the Word) for a reminder, </P>
<P><A NAME="037_004"><span class=textnos>4</span><br>
Lo! thy Lord is surely One; </P>
<P><A NAME="037_005"><span class=textnos>5</span><br>
Lord of the heavens and of the earth and all that is between them, and Lord  of the sun's risings. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_006"><span class=textnos>6</span><br>
Lo! We have adorned the lowest heaven with an ornament, the planets; </P>
<P><A NAME="037_007"><span class=textnos>7</span><br>
With security from every froward devil. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_008"><span class=textnos>8</span><br>
They cannot listen to the Highest Chiefs for they are pelted from every side, </P>
<P><A NAME="037_009"><span class=textnos>9</span><br>
Outcast, and theirs is a perpetual torment; </P>
<P><A NAME="037_010"><span class=textnos>10</span><br>
Save him who snatcheth a fragment, and there pursueth him a piercing flame. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_011"><span class=textnos>11</span><br>
Then ask them (O Muhammad): Are they stronger as a creation, or those  (others) whom we have created ? Lo! We created them of plastic clay. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_012"><span class=textnos>12</span><br>
Nay, but thou dost marvel when they mock </P>
<P><A NAME="037_013"><span class=textnos>13</span><br>
And heed not when they are reminded, </P>
<P><A NAME="037_014"><span class=textnos>14</span><br>
And seek to scoff when they behold a portent. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_015"><span class=textnos>15</span><br>
And they say: Lo! this is mere magic; </P>
<P><A NAME="037_016"><span class=textnos>16</span><br>
When we are dead and have become dust and bones, shall we then, forsooth,  be raised (again) ? </P>
<P><A NAME="037_017"><span class=textnos>17</span><br>
And our forefathers ? </P>
<P><A NAME="037_018"><span class=textnos>18</span><br>
Say (O Muhammad): Ye, in truth; and ye will be brought low. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_019"><span class=textnos>19</span><br>
There is but one Shout, and lo! they behold, </P>
<P><A NAME="037_020"><span class=textnos>20</span><br>
And say: Ah, woe for us! This is the Day of Judgment. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_021"><span class=textnos>21</span><br>
This is the Day of Separation, which ye used to deny. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_022"><span class=textnos>22</span><br>
(And it is said unto the angels): Assemble those who did wrong, together  with their wives and what they used to worship </P>
<P><A NAME="037_023"><span class=textnos>23</span><br>
Instead of Allah, and lead them to the path to hell; </P>
<P><A NAME="037_024"><span class=textnos>24</span><br>
And stop them, for they must be questioned. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_025"><span class=textnos>25</span><br>
What aileth you that ye help not one another ? </P>
<P><A NAME="037_026"><span class=textnos>26</span><br>
Nay, but this day they make full submission. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_027"><span class=textnos>27</span><br>
And some of them draw near unto others, mutually questioning. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_028"><span class=textnos>28</span><br>
They say: Lo! ye used to come unto us, imposing, (swearing that ye spoke  the truth). </P>
<P><A NAME="037_029"><span class=textnos>29</span><br>
They answer: Nay, but ye (yourselves) were not believers. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_030"><span class=textnos>30</span><br>
We had no power over you, but ye were wayward folk. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_031"><span class=textnos>31</span><br>
Now the Word of our Lord hath been fulfilled concerning us. Lo! we are  about to taste (the doom). </P>
<P><A NAME="037_032"><span class=textnos>32</span><br>
Thus we misled you. Lo! we were (ourselves) astray. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_033"><span class=textnos>33</span><br>
Then lo! this day they (both) are sharers in the doom. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_034"><span class=textnos>34</span><br>
Lo! thus deal We with the guilty. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_035"><span class=textnos>35</span><br>
For when it was said unto them, There is no God save Allah, they were  scornful </P>
<P><A NAME="037_036"><span class=textnos>36</span><br>
And said: Shall we forsake our gods for a mad poet ? </P>
<P><A NAME="037_037"><span class=textnos>37</span><br>
Nay, but he brought the Truth, and he confirmed those sent (before him). </P>
<P><A NAME="037_038"><span class=textnos>38</span><br>
Lo! (now) verily ye taste the painful doom - </P>
<P><A NAME="037_039"><span class=textnos>39</span><br>
Ye are requited naught save what ye did - </P>
<P><A NAME="037_040"><span class=textnos>40</span><br>
Save single-minded slaves of Allah; </P>
<P><A NAME="037_041"><span class=textnos>41</span><br>
For them there is a known provision, </P>
<P><A NAME="037_042"><span class=textnos>42</span><br>
Fruits. And they will be honoured </P>
<P><A NAME="037_043"><span class=textnos>43</span><br>
In the Gardens of delight, </P>
<P><A NAME="037_044"><span class=textnos>44</span><br>
On couches facing one another; </P>
<P><A NAME="037_045"><span class=textnos>45</span><br>
A cup from a gushing spring is brought round for them, </P>
<P><A NAME="037_046"><span class=textnos>46</span><br>
White, delicious to the drinkers, </P>
<P><A NAME="037_047"><span class=textnos>47</span><br>
Wherein there is no headache nor are they made mad thereby. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_048"><span class=textnos>48</span><br>
And with them are those of modest gaze, with lovely eyes, </P>
<P><A NAME="037_049"><span class=textnos>49</span><br>
(Pure) as they were hidden eggs (of the ostrich). </P>
<P><A NAME="037_050"><span class=textnos>50</span><br>
And some of them draw near unto others, mutually questioning. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_051"><span class=textnos>51</span><br>
A speaker of them saith: Lo! I had a comrade </P>
<P><A NAME="037_052"><span class=textnos>52</span><br>
Who used to say: Art thou in truth of those who put faith (in his words) ? </P>
<P><A NAME="037_053"><span class=textnos>53</span><br>
Can we, when we are dead and have become mere dust and bones - can we  (then) verily be brought to book ? </P>
<P><A NAME="037_054"><span class=textnos>54</span><br>
He saith: Will ye look ? </P>
<P><A NAME="037_055"><span class=textnos>55</span><br>
Then looketh he and seeth him in the depth of hell. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_056"><span class=textnos>56</span><br>
He saith: By Allah, thou verily didst all but cause my ruin, </P>
<P><A NAME="037_057"><span class=textnos>57</span><br>
And had it not been for the favour of my Lord, I too had been of those haled  forth (to doom). </P>
<P><A NAME="037_058"><span class=textnos>58</span><br>
Are we then not to die </P>
<P><A NAME="037_059"><span class=textnos>59</span><br>
Saving our former death, and are we not to be punished ? </P>
<P><A NAME="037_060"><span class=textnos>60</span><br>
Lo! this is the supreme triumph. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_061"><span class=textnos>61</span><br>
For the like of this, then, let the workers work. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_062"><span class=textnos>62</span><br>
Is this better as a welcome, or the tree of Zaqqum ? </P>
<P><A NAME="037_063"><span class=textnos>63</span><br>
Lo! We have appointed it a torment for wrong-doers. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_064"><span class=textnos>64</span><br>
Lo! it is a tree that springeth in the heart of hell. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_065"><span class=textnos>65</span><br>
Its crop is as it were the heads of devils </P>
<P><A NAME="037_066"><span class=textnos>66</span><br>
And lo! they verily must eat thereof, and fill (their) bellies therewith. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_067"><span class=textnos>67</span><br>
And afterward, lo! thereupon they have a drink of boiling water </P>
<P><A NAME="037_068"><span class=textnos>68</span><br>
And afterward, lo! their return is surely unto hell. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_069"><span class=textnos>69</span><br>
They indeed found their fathers astray, </P>
<P><A NAME="037_070"><span class=textnos>70</span><br>
But they make haste (to follow) in their footsteps. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_071"><span class=textnos>71</span><br>
And verily most of the men of old went astray before them, </P>
<P><A NAME="037_072"><span class=textnos>72</span><br>
And verily We sent among them warners. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_073"><span class=textnos>73</span><br>
Then see the nature of the consequence for those warned, </P>
<P><A NAME="037_074"><span class=textnos>74</span><br>
Save single-minded slaves of Allah. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_075"><span class=textnos>75</span><br>
And Noah verily prayed unto Us, and gracious was the Hearer of his prayer </P>
<P><A NAME="037_076"><span class=textnos>76</span><br>
And We saved him and his household from the great distress, </P>
<P><A NAME="037_077"><span class=textnos>77</span><br>
And made his seed the survivors, </P>
<P><A NAME="037_078"><span class=textnos>78</span><br>
And left for him among the later folk (the salutation): </P>
<P><A NAME="037_079"><span class=textnos>79</span><br>
Peace be unto Noah among the peoples! </P>
<P><A NAME="037_080"><span class=textnos>80</span><br>
Lo! thus do We reward the good. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_081"><span class=textnos>81</span><br>
Lo! he is one of Our believing slaves. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_082"><span class=textnos>82</span><br>
Then We did drown the others. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_083"><span class=textnos>83</span><br>
And lo! of his persuasion verily was Abraham </P>
<P><A NAME="037_084"><span class=textnos>84</span><br>
When he came unto his Lord with a whole heart; </P>
<P><A NAME="037_085"><span class=textnos>85</span><br>
When he said unto his father and his folk: What is it that ye worship ? </P>
<P><A NAME="037_086"><span class=textnos>86</span><br>
Is it a falsehood - gods beside Allah - that ye desire ? </P>
<P><A NAME="037_087"><span class=textnos>87</span><br>
What then is your opinion of the Lord of the Worlds ? </P>
<P><A NAME="037_088"><span class=textnos>88</span><br>
And he glanced a glance at the stars </P>
<P><A NAME="037_089"><span class=textnos>89</span><br>
Then said: Lo! I feel sick! </P>

<!--#include virtual="/table_middle.txt"-->


<P><A NAME="037_090"><span class=textnos>90</span><br>
And they turned their backs and went away from him. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_091"><span class=textnos>91</span><br>
Then turned he to their gods and said: Will ye not eat ? </P>
<P><A NAME="037_092"><span class=textnos>92</span><br>
What aileth you that ye speak not ? </P>
<P><A NAME="037_093"><span class=textnos>93</span><br>
Then he attacked them, striking with his right hand. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_094"><span class=textnos>94</span><br>
And (his people) came toward him, hastening. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_095"><span class=textnos>95</span><br>
He said: Worship ye that which ye yourselves do carve </P>
<P><A NAME="037_096"><span class=textnos>96</span><br>
When Allah hath created you and what ye make ? </P>
<P><A NAME="037_097"><span class=textnos>97</span><br>
They said: Build for him a building and fling him in the red-hotfire. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_098"><span class=textnos>98</span><br>
And they designed a snare for him, but We made them the undermost. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_099"><span class=textnos>99</span><br>
And he said: Lo! I am going unto my Lord Who will guide me. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_100"><span class=textnos>100</span><br>
My Lord! Vouchsafe me of the righteous. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_101"><span class=textnos>101</span><br>
So We gave him tidings of a gentle son. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_102"><span class=textnos>102</span><br>
And when (his son) was old enough to walk with him, (Abraham) said: O my  dear son, I have seen in a dream that I must sacrifice thee. So look, what thinkest thou  ? He said: O my father! Do that which thou art commanded. Allah willing, thou shalt  find me of the steadfast. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_103"><span class=textnos>103</span><br>
Then, when they had both surrendered (to Allah), and he had flung him down  upon his face, </P>
<P><A NAME="037_104"><span class=textnos>104</span><br>
We called unto him: O Abraham! </P>
<P><A NAME="037_105"><span class=textnos>105</span><br>
Thou hast already fulfilled the vision. Lo! thus do We reward the good. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_106"><span class=textnos>106</span><br>
Lo! that verily was a clear test. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_107"><span class=textnos>107</span><br>
Then We ransomed him with a tremendous victim. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_108"><span class=textnos>108</span><br>
And We left for him among the later folk (the salutation): </P>
<P><A NAME="037_109"><span class=textnos>109</span><br>
Peace be unto Abraham! </P>
<P><A NAME="037_110"><span class=textnos>110</span><br>
Thus do We reward the good. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_111"><span class=textnos>111</span><br>
Lo! he is one of Our believing slaves. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_112"><span class=textnos>112</span><br>
And we gave him tidings of the birth of Isaac, a prophet of the righteous. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_113"><span class=textnos>113</span><br>
And We blessed him and Isaac. And of their seed are some who do good, and  some who plainly wrong themselves. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_114"><span class=textnos>114</span><br>
And We verily gave grace unto Moses and Aaron, </P>
<P><A NAME="037_115"><span class=textnos>115</span><br>
And saved them and their people from the great distress, </P>
<P><A NAME="037_116"><span class=textnos>116</span><br>
And helped them so that they became the victors. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_117"><span class=textnos>117</span><br>
And We gave them the clear Scripture </P>
<P><A NAME="037_118"><span class=textnos>118</span><br>
And showed them the right path. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_119"><span class=textnos>119</span><br>
And We left for them among the later folk (the salutation): </P>
<P><A NAME="037_120"><span class=textnos>120</span><br>
Peace be unto Moses and Aaron! </P>
<P><A NAME="037_121"><span class=textnos>121</span><br>
Lo! thus do We reward the good. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_122"><span class=textnos>122</span><br>
Lo! they are two of Our believing slaves. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_123"><span class=textnos>123</span><br>
And lo! Elias was of those sent (to warn), </P>
<P><A NAME="037_124"><span class=textnos>124</span><br>
When he said unto his folk: Will ye not ward off (evil) ? </P>
<P><A NAME="037_125"><span class=textnos>125</span><br>
Will ye cry unto Baal and forsake the Best of creators, </P>
<P><A NAME="037_126"><span class=textnos>126</span><br>
Allah, your Lord and Lord of your forefathers ? </P>
<P><A NAME="037_127"><span class=textnos>127</span><br>
But they denied him, so they surely will be haled forth (to the doom) </P>
<P><A NAME="037_128"><span class=textnos>128</span><br>
Save single-minded slaves of Allah. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_129"><span class=textnos>129</span><br>
And we left for him among the later folk (the salutation): </P>
<P><A NAME="037_130"><span class=textnos>130</span><br>
Peace be unto Elias! </P>
<P><A NAME="037_131"><span class=textnos>131</span><br>
Lo! thus do We reward the good. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_132"><span class=textnos>132</span><br>
Lo! he is one of our believing slaves. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_133"><span class=textnos>133</span><br>
And lo! Lot verily was of those sent (to warn). </P>
<P><A NAME="037_134"><span class=textnos>134</span><br>
When We saved him and his household, every one, </P>
<P><A NAME="037_135"><span class=textnos>135</span><br>
Save an old woman among those who stayed behind; </P>
<P><A NAME="037_136"><span class=textnos>136</span><br>
Then We destroyed the others. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_137"><span class=textnos>137</span><br>
And lo! ye verily pass by (the ruin of) them in the morning </P>
<P><A NAME="037_138"><span class=textnos>138</span><br>
And at night-time; have ye then no sense ? </P>
<P><A NAME="037_139"><span class=textnos>139</span><br>
And lo! Jonah verily was of those sent (to warn) </P>
<P><A NAME="037_140"><span class=textnos>140</span><br>
When he fled unto the laden ship, </P>
<P><A NAME="037_141"><span class=textnos>141</span><br>
And then drew lots and was of those rejected; </P>
<P><A NAME="037_142"><span class=textnos>142</span><br>
And the fish swallowed him while he was blameworthy; </P>
<P><A NAME="037_143"><span class=textnos>143</span><br>
And had he not been one of those who glorify (Allah) </P>
<P><A NAME="037_144"><span class=textnos>144</span><br>
He would have tarried in its belly till the day when they are raised; </P>
<P><A NAME="037_145"><span class=textnos>145</span><br>
Then We cast him on a desert shore while he was sick; </P>
<P><A NAME="037_146"><span class=textnos>146</span><br>
And We caused a tree of gourd to grow above him; </P>
<P><A NAME="037_147"><span class=textnos>147</span><br>
And We sent him to a hundred thousand (folk) or more </P>
<P><A NAME="037_148"><span class=textnos>148</span><br>
And they believed, therefor We gave them comfort for a while. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_149"><span class=textnos>149</span><br>
Now ask them (O Muhammad): Hath thy Lord daughters whereas they have  sons ? </P>
<P><A NAME="037_150"><span class=textnos>150</span><br>
Or created We the angels females while they were present ? </P>
<P><A NAME="037_151"><span class=textnos>151</span><br>
Lo! it is of their falsehood that they say: </P>
<P><A NAME="037_152"><span class=textnos>152</span><br>
Allah hath begotten. Allah! verily they tell a lie. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_153"><span class=textnos>153</span><br>
(And again of their falsehood): He hath preferred daughters to sons. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_154"><span class=textnos>154</span><br>
What aileth you ? How judge ye ? </P>
<P><A NAME="037_155"><span class=textnos>155</span><br>
Will ye not then reflect ? </P>
<P><A NAME="037_156"><span class=textnos>156</span><br>
Or have ye a clear warrant ? </P>
<P><A NAME="037_157"><span class=textnos>157</span><br>
Then produce your writ, if ye are truthful. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_158"><span class=textnos>158</span><br>
And they imagine kinship between him and the jinn, whereas the jinn know  well that they will be brought before (Him). </P>
<P><A NAME="037_159"><span class=textnos>159</span><br>
Glorified be Allah from that which they attribute (unto Him), </P>
<P><A NAME="037_160"><span class=textnos>160</span><br>
Save single-minded slaves of Allah. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_161"><span class=textnos>161</span><br>
Lo! verily, ye and that which ye worship, </P>
<P><A NAME="037_162"><span class=textnos>162</span><br>
Ye cannot excite (anyone) against Him. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_163"><span class=textnos>163</span><br>
Save him who is to burn in hell. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_164"><span class=textnos>164</span><br>
There is not one of us but hath his known position. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_165"><span class=textnos>165</span><br>
Lo! we, even we are they who set the ranks, </P>
<P><A NAME="037_166"><span class=textnos>166</span><br>
Lo! we, even we are they who hymn His praise </P>
<P><A NAME="037_167"><span class=textnos>167</span><br>
And indeed they used to say: </P>
<P><A NAME="037_168"><span class=textnos>168</span><br>
If we had but a reminder from the men of old </P>
<P><A NAME="037_169"><span class=textnos>169</span><br>
We would be single-minded slaves of Allah. </P>
