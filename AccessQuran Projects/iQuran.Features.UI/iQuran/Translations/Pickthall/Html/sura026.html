<P><A NAME="026_001"><span class=textnos>1</span><br>
Ta. Sin. Mim. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_002"><span class=textnos>2</span><br>
These are revelations of the Scripture that maketh plain. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_003"><span class=textnos>3</span><br>
It may be that thou tormentest thyself (O Muhammad) because they believe  not. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_004"><span class=textnos>4</span><br>
If We will, We can send down on them from the sky a portent so that their  necks would remain bowed before it. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_005"><span class=textnos>5</span><br>
Never cometh there unto them a fresh reminder from the Beneficent One, but  they turn away from it. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_006"><span class=textnos>6</span><br>
Now they have denied (the Truth); but there will come unto them tidings of  that whereat they used to scoff. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_007"><span class=textnos>7</span><br>
Have they not seen the earth, how much of every fruitful kind We make to  grow therein ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_008"><span class=textnos>8</span><br>
Lo! herein is indeed a portent; yet most of them are not believers. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_009"><span class=textnos>9</span><br>
And lo! thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_010"><span class=textnos>10</span><br>
And when thy Lord called Moses, saying: Go unto the wrongdoing folk, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_011"><span class=textnos>11</span><br>
The folk of Pharaoh. Will they not ward off (evil) ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_012"><span class=textnos>12</span><br>
He said: My Lord! Lo! I fear that they will deny me, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_013"><span class=textnos>13</span><br>
And I shall be embarrassed, and my tongue will not speak plainly, therefor  send for Aaron (to help me). </P>
<P><A NAME="026_014"><span class=textnos>14</span><br>
And they have a crime against me, so I fear that they will kill me. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_015"><span class=textnos>15</span><br>
He said: Nay, verily. So go ye twain with Our tokens. Lo! We shall be with  you, Hearing. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_016"><span class=textnos>16</span><br>
And come together unto Pharaoh and say: Lo! we bear a message of the Lord  of the Worlds, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_017"><span class=textnos>17</span><br>
(Saying): Let the Children of Israel go with us. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_018"><span class=textnos>18</span><br>
(Pharaoh) said (unto Moses): Did we not rear thee among us as a child ? And  thou didst dwell many years of thy life among us, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_019"><span class=textnos>19</span><br>
And thou didst that thy deed which thou didst, and thou wast one of the  ingrates. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_020"><span class=textnos>20</span><br>
He said: I did it then, when I was of those who are astray. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_021"><span class=textnos>21</span><br>
Then I fled from you when I feared you, and my Lord vouchsafed me a  command and appointed me (of the number) of those sent (by Him). </P>
<P><A NAME="026_022"><span class=textnos>22</span><br>
And this is the past favour wherewith thou reproachest me: that thou hast  enslaved the Children of Israel. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_023"><span class=textnos>23</span><br>
Pharaoh said: And what is the Lord of the Worlds ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_024"><span class=textnos>24</span><br>
(Moses) said: Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them,  if ye had but sure belief. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_025"><span class=textnos>25</span><br>
(Pharaoh) said unto those around him: Hear ye not ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_026"><span class=textnos>26</span><br>
He said: Your Lord and the Lord of your fathers. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_027"><span class=textnos>27</span><br>
(Pharaoh) said: Lo! your messenger who hath been sent unto you is indeed a  madman! </P>
<P><A NAME="026_028"><span class=textnos>28</span><br>
He said: Lord of the East and the West and all that is between them, if ye did  but understand. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_029"><span class=textnos>29</span><br>
(Pharaoh) said: If thou choosest a god other than me, I assuredly shall place  thee among the prisoners. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_030"><span class=textnos>30</span><br>
He said: Even though I show thee something plain ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_031"><span class=textnos>31</span><br>
(Pharaoh) said: Produce it then, if thou art of the truthful! </P>
<P><A NAME="026_032"><span class=textnos>32</span><br>
Then he flung down his staff and it became a serpent manifest, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_033"><span class=textnos>33</span><br>
And he drew forth his hand and lo! it was white to the beholders. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_034"><span class=textnos>34</span><br>
(Pharaoh) said unto the chiefs about him: Lo! this is verily a knowing  wizard, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_035"><span class=textnos>35</span><br>
Who would drive you out of your land by his magic. Now what counsel ye ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_036"><span class=textnos>36</span><br>
They said: Put him off, (him) and his brother, and send into the cities  summoners </P>
<P><A NAME="026_037"><span class=textnos>37</span><br>
Who shall bring unto thee every knowing wizard. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_038"><span class=textnos>38</span><br>
So the wizards were gathered together at a set time on a day appointed. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_039"><span class=textnos>39</span><br>
And it was said unto the people: Are ye (also) gathering ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_040"><span class=textnos>40</span><br>
(They said): Aye, so that we may follow the wizards if they are the winners. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_041"><span class=textnos>41</span><br>
And when the wizards came they said unto Pharaoh: Will there surely be a  reward for us if we are the winners ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_042"><span class=textnos>42</span><br>
He said: Aye, and ye will then surely be of those brought near (to me). </P>
<P><A NAME="026_043"><span class=textnos>43</span><br>
Moses said unto them: Throw what ye are going to throw! </P>
<P><A NAME="026_044"><span class=textnos>44</span><br>
Then they threw down their cords and their staves and said: By Pharaoh's  might, lo! we verily are the winners. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_045"><span class=textnos>45</span><br>
Then Moses threw his staff and lo! it swallowed that which they did falsely  show. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_046"><span class=textnos>46</span><br>
And the wizards were flung prostrate, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_047"><span class=textnos>47</span><br>
Crying: We believe in the Lord of the Worlds, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_048"><span class=textnos>48</span><br>
The Lord of Moses and Aaron. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_049"><span class=textnos>49</span><br>
(Pharaoh) said: Ye put your faith in him before I give you leave. Lo! he  doubtless is your chief who taught you magic! But verily ye shall come to know.  Verily I will cut off your hands and your feet alternately, and verily I will crucify you  every one. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_050"><span class=textnos>50</span><br>
They said: It is no hurt, for lo! unto our Lord we shall return. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_051"><span class=textnos>51</span><br>
Lo! we ardently hope that our Lord will forgive us our sins because we are  the first of the believers. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_052"><span class=textnos>52</span><br>
And We inspired Moses, saying: Take away My slaves by night, for ye will  be pursued. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_053"><span class=textnos>53</span><br>
Then Pharaoh sent into the cities summoners, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_054"><span class=textnos>54</span><br>
(Who said): Lo! these indeed are but a little troop, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_055"><span class=textnos>55</span><br>
And lo! they are offenders against us. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_056"><span class=textnos>56</span><br>
And lo! we are a ready host. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_057"><span class=textnos>57</span><br>
Thus did We take them away from gardens and watersprings, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_058"><span class=textnos>58</span><br>
And treasures and a fair estate. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_059"><span class=textnos>59</span><br>
Thus (were those things taken from them) and We caused the Children of  Israel to inherit them. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_060"><span class=textnos>60</span><br>
And they overtook them at sunrise. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_061"><span class=textnos>61</span><br>
And when the two hosts saw each other, those with Moses said: Lo! we are  indeed caught. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_062"><span class=textnos>62</span><br>
He said: Nay, verily! for lo! my Lord is with me. He will guide me. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_063"><span class=textnos>63</span><br>
Then We inspired Moses, saying: Smite the sea with thy staff. And it parted,  and each part was as a mountain vast. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_064"><span class=textnos>64</span><br>
Then brought We near the others to that place. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_065"><span class=textnos>65</span><br>
And We saved Moses and those with him, every one; </P>
<P><A NAME="026_066"><span class=textnos>66</span><br>
And We drowned the others. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_067"><span class=textnos>67</span><br>
Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_068"><span class=textnos>68</span><br>
And lo, thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_069"><span class=textnos>69</span><br>
Recite unto them the story of Abraham: </P>
<P><A NAME="026_070"><span class=textnos>70</span><br>
When he said unto his father and his folk: What worship ye ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_071"><span class=textnos>71</span><br>
They said: We worship idols, and are ever devoted unto them. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_072"><span class=textnos>72</span><br>
He said: Do they hear you when ye cry ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_073"><span class=textnos>73</span><br>
Or do they benefit or harm you ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_074"><span class=textnos>74</span><br>
They said: Nay, but we found our fathers acting on this wise. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_075"><span class=textnos>75</span><br>
He said: See now that which ye worship, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_076"><span class=textnos>76</span><br>
Ye and your forefathers! </P>
<P><A NAME="026_077"><span class=textnos>77</span><br>
Lo! they are (all) an enemy unto me, save the Lord of the Worlds, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_078"><span class=textnos>78</span><br>
Who created me, and He doth guide me, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_079"><span class=textnos>79</span><br>
And Who feedeth me and watereth me. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_080"><span class=textnos>80</span><br>
And when I sicken, then He healeth me, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_081"><span class=textnos>81</span><br>
And Who causeth me to die, then giveth me life (again), </P>
<P><A NAME="026_082"><span class=textnos>82</span><br>
And Who, I ardently hope, will forgive me my sin on the Day of Judgment. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_083"><span class=textnos>83</span><br>
My Lord! Vouchsafe me wisdom and unite me to the righteous. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_084"><span class=textnos>84</span><br>
And give unto me a good report in later generations. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_085"><span class=textnos>85</span><br>
And place me among the inheritors of the Garden of Delight, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_086"><span class=textnos>86</span><br>
And forgive my father. Lo! he is of those who err. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_087"><span class=textnos>87</span><br>
And abase me not on the day when they are raised, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_088"><span class=textnos>88</span><br>
The day when wealth and sons avail not (any man) </P>
<P><A NAME="026_089"><span class=textnos>89</span><br>
Save him who bringeth unto Allah a whole heart. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_090"><span class=textnos>90</span><br>
And the Garden will be brought nigh for those who ward off (evil). </P>
<P><A NAME="026_091"><span class=textnos>91</span><br>
And hell will appear plainly to the erring. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_092"><span class=textnos>92</span><br>
And it will be said unto them: Where is (all) that ye used to worship </P>
<P><A NAME="026_093"><span class=textnos>93</span><br>
Instead of Allah ? Can they help you or help themselves ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_094"><span class=textnos>94</span><br>
Then will they be hurled therein, they and the seducers </P>
<P><A NAME="026_095"><span class=textnos>95</span><br>
And the hosts of Iblis, together. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_096"><span class=textnos>96</span><br>
And they will say, when they are quarrelling therein: </P>
<P><A NAME="026_097"><span class=textnos>97</span><br>
By Allah, of a truth we were in error manifest </P>
<P><A NAME="026_098"><span class=textnos>98</span><br>
When we made you equal with the Lord of the Worlds. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_099"><span class=textnos>99</span><br>
It was but the guilty who misled us. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_100"><span class=textnos>100</span><br>
Now we have no intercessors </P>
<P><A NAME="026_101"><span class=textnos>101</span><br>
Nor any loving friend. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_102"><span class=textnos>102</span><br>
Oh, that we had another turn (on earth), that we might be of the believers! </P>
<P><A NAME="026_103"><span class=textnos>103</span><br>
Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers! </P>
<P><A NAME="026_104"><span class=textnos>104</span><br>
And lo, thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_105"><span class=textnos>105</span><br>
Noah's folk denied the messengers (of Allah), </P>
<P><A NAME="026_106"><span class=textnos>106</span><br>
When their brother Noah said unto them: Will ye not ward off (evil) ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_107"><span class=textnos>107</span><br>
Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_108"><span class=textnos>108</span><br>
So keep your duty to Allah, and obey me. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_109"><span class=textnos>109</span><br>
And I ask of you no wage therefor; my wage is the concern only of the Lord  of the Worlds. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_110"><span class=textnos>110</span><br>
So keep your duty to Allah, and obey me. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_111"><span class=textnos>111</span><br>
They said: Shall we put faith in thee, when the lowest (of the people) follow  thee ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_112"><span class=textnos>112</span><br>
He said: And what knowledge have I of what they may have been doing (in  the past) ? </P>

<!--#include virtual="/table_middle.txt"-->


<P><A NAME="026_113"><span class=textnos>113</span><br>
Lo! their reckoning is my Lord's concern, if ye but knew; </P>
<P><A NAME="026_114"><span class=textnos>114</span><br>
And I am not (here) to repulse believers. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_115"><span class=textnos>115</span><br>
I am only a plain warner. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_116"><span class=textnos>116</span><br>
They said: If thou cease not, O Noah, thou wilt surely be among those stoned  (to death). </P>
<P><A NAME="026_117"><span class=textnos>117</span><br>
He said: My Lord! Lo! my own folk deny me. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_118"><span class=textnos>118</span><br>
Therefor judge Thou between us, a (conclusive) judgment, and save me and  those believers who are with me. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_119"><span class=textnos>119</span><br>
And We saved him and those with him in the laden ship. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_120"><span class=textnos>120</span><br>
Then afterward We drowned the others. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_121"><span class=textnos>121</span><br>
Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_122"><span class=textnos>122</span><br>
And lo, thy Lord, He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_123"><span class=textnos>123</span><br>
(The tribe of) A'ad denied the messengers (of Allah). </P>
<P><A NAME="026_124"><span class=textnos>124</span><br>
When their brother Hud said unto them: Will ye not ward off (evil) ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_125"><span class=textnos>125</span><br>
Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_126"><span class=textnos>126</span><br>
So keep your duty to Allah and obey me. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_127"><span class=textnos>127</span><br>
And I ask of you no wage therefor; my wage is the concern only of the Lord  of the Worlds. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_128"><span class=textnos>128</span><br>
Build ye on every high place a monument for vain delight ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_129"><span class=textnos>129</span><br>
And seek ye out strongholds, that haply ye may last for ever ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_130"><span class=textnos>130</span><br>
And if ye seize by force, seize ye as tyrants ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_131"><span class=textnos>131</span><br>
Rather keep your duty to Allah, and obey me. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_132"><span class=textnos>132</span><br>
Keep your duty toward Him Who hath aided you with (the good things) that  ye know, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_133"><span class=textnos>133</span><br>
Hath aided you with cattle and sons. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_134"><span class=textnos>134</span><br>
And gardens and watersprings. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_135"><span class=textnos>135</span><br>
Lo! I fear for you the retribution of an awful day. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_136"><span class=textnos>136</span><br>
They said: It is all one to us whether thou preachest or art not of those who  preach; </P>
<P><A NAME="026_137"><span class=textnos>137</span><br>
This is but a fable of the men of old, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_138"><span class=textnos>138</span><br>
And we shall not be doomed. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_139"><span class=textnos>139</span><br>
And they denied him; therefor We destroyed them. Lo! herein is indeed a  portent, yet most of them are not believers. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_140"><span class=textnos>140</span><br>
And lo! thy Lord, He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_141"><span class=textnos>141</span><br>
(The tribe of) Thamud denied the messengers (of Allah) </P>
<P><A NAME="026_142"><span class=textnos>142</span><br>
When their brother Salih said unto them: Will ye not ward off (evil) ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_143"><span class=textnos>143</span><br>
Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_144"><span class=textnos>144</span><br>
So keep your duty to Allah and obey me. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_145"><span class=textnos>145</span><br>
And I ask of you no wage therefor; my wage is the concern only of the Lord  of the Worlds. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_146"><span class=textnos>146</span><br>
Will ye be left secure in that which is here before us, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_147"><span class=textnos>147</span><br>
In gardens and watersprings. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_148"><span class=textnos>148</span><br>
And tilled fields and heavy-sheathed palm-trees, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_149"><span class=textnos>149</span><br>
Though ye hew out dwellings in the mountain, being skilful ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_150"><span class=textnos>150</span><br>
Therefor keep your duty to Allah and obey me, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_151"><span class=textnos>151</span><br>
And obey not the command of the prodigal, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_152"><span class=textnos>152</span><br>
Who spread corruption in the earth, and reform not. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_153"><span class=textnos>153</span><br>
They said: Thou art but one of the bewitched; </P>
<P><A NAME="026_154"><span class=textnos>154</span><br>
Thou art but a mortal like us. So bring some token if thou art of the truthful. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_155"><span class=textnos>155</span><br>
He said: (Behold) this she-camel. She hath the right to drink (at the well),  and ye have the right to drink, (each) on an appointed day. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_156"><span class=textnos>156</span><br>
And touch her not with ill lest there come on you the retribution of an awful  day. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_157"><span class=textnos>157</span><br>
But they hamstrung her, and then were penitent. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_158"><span class=textnos>158</span><br>
So the retribution came on them. Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of  them are not believers. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_159"><span class=textnos>159</span><br>
And lo! thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_160"><span class=textnos>160</span><br>
The folk of Lot denied the messengers (of Allah), </P>
<P><A NAME="026_161"><span class=textnos>161</span><br>
When their brother Lot said unto them: Will ye not ward off (evil) ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_162"><span class=textnos>162</span><br>
Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_163"><span class=textnos>163</span><br>
So keep your duty to Allah and obey me. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_164"><span class=textnos>164</span><br>
And I ask of you no wage therefor; my wage is the concern only of the Lord  of the Worlds. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_165"><span class=textnos>165</span><br>
What! Of all creatures do ye come unto the males, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_166"><span class=textnos>166</span><br>
And leave the wives your Lord created for you ? Nay, but ye are froward  folk. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_167"><span class=textnos>167</span><br>
They said: If thou cease not, O Lot, thou wilt soon be of the outcast. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_168"><span class=textnos>168</span><br>
He said: I am in truth of those who hate your conduct. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_169"><span class=textnos>169</span><br>
My Lord! Save me and my household from what they do. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_170"><span class=textnos>170</span><br>
So We saved him and his household, every one, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_171"><span class=textnos>171</span><br>
Save an old woman among those who stayed behind. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_172"><span class=textnos>172</span><br>
Then afterward We destroyed the others. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_173"><span class=textnos>173</span><br>
And We rained on them a rain. And dreadful is the rain of those who have  been warned. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_174"><span class=textnos>174</span><br>
Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_175"><span class=textnos>175</span><br>
And lo! thy Lord, He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_176"><span class=textnos>176</span><br>
The dwellers in the wood (of Midian) denied the messengers (of Allah), </P>
<P><A NAME="026_177"><span class=textnos>177</span><br>
When Shu'eyb said unto them: Will ye not ward off (evil) ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_178"><span class=textnos>178</span><br>
Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_179"><span class=textnos>179</span><br>
So keep your duty to Allah and obey me. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_180"><span class=textnos>180</span><br>
And I ask of you no wage for it; my wage is the concern only of the Lord of  the Worlds. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_181"><span class=textnos>181</span><br>
Give full measure, and be not of those who give less (than the due). </P>
<P><A NAME="026_182"><span class=textnos>182</span><br>
And weigh with the true balance. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_183"><span class=textnos>183</span><br>
Wrong not mankind in their goods, and do not evil, making mischief, in the  earth. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_184"><span class=textnos>184</span><br>
And keep your duty unto Him Who created you and the generations of the  men of old. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_185"><span class=textnos>185</span><br>
They said: Thou art but one of the bewitched; </P>
<P><A NAME="026_186"><span class=textnos>186</span><br>
Thou art but a mortal like us, and lo! we deem thee of the liars. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_187"><span class=textnos>187</span><br>
Then make fragments of the heaven fall upon us, if thou art of the truthful. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_188"><span class=textnos>188</span><br>
He said: My Lord is Best Aware of what ye do. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_189"><span class=textnos>189</span><br>
But they denied him, so there came on them the retribution of the day of  gloom. Lo! it was the retribution of an awful day. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_190"><span class=textnos>190</span><br>
Lo! herein is indeed a portent; yet most of them are not believers. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_191"><span class=textnos>191</span><br>
And lo! thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_192"><span class=textnos>192</span><br>
And lo! it is a revelation of the Lord of the Worlds, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_193"><span class=textnos>193</span><br>
Which the True Spirit hath brought down </P>
<P><A NAME="026_194"><span class=textnos>194</span><br>
Upon thy heart, that thou mayst be (one) of the warners, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_195"><span class=textnos>195</span><br>
In plain Arabic speech. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_196"><span class=textnos>196</span><br>
And lo! it is in the Scriptures of the men of old. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_197"><span class=textnos>197</span><br>
Is it not a token for them that the doctors of the Children of Israel know it ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_198"><span class=textnos>198</span><br>
And if We had revealed it unto one of any other nation than the Arabs, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_199"><span class=textnos>199</span><br>
And he had read it unto them, they would not have believed in it. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_200"><span class=textnos>200</span><br>
Thus do We make it traverse the hearts of the guilty. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_201"><span class=textnos>201</span><br>
They will not believe in it till they behold the painful doom, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_202"><span class=textnos>202</span><br>
So that it will come upon them suddenly, when they perceive not. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_203"><span class=textnos>203</span><br>
Then they will say: Are we to be reprieved ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_204"><span class=textnos>204</span><br>
Would they (now) hasten on Our doom ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_205"><span class=textnos>205</span><br>
Hast thou then seen, if We content them for (long) years, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_206"><span class=textnos>206</span><br>
And then cometh that which they were promised, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_207"><span class=textnos>207</span><br>
(How) that wherewith they were contented naught availeth them ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_208"><span class=textnos>208</span><br>
And We destroyed no township but it had its warners </P>
<P><A NAME="026_209"><span class=textnos>209</span><br>
For reminder, for We never were oppressors. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_210"><span class=textnos>210</span><br>
The devils did not bring it down. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_211"><span class=textnos>211</span><br>
It is not meet for them, nor is it in their power, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_212"><span class=textnos>212</span><br>
Lo! verily they are banished from the hearing. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_213"><span class=textnos>213</span><br>
Therefor invoke not with Allah another god, lest thou be one of the doomed. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_214"><span class=textnos>214</span><br>
And warn thy tribe of near kindred, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_215"><span class=textnos>215</span><br>
And lower thy wing (in kindness) unto those believers who follow thee. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_216"><span class=textnos>216</span><br>
And if they (thy kinsfolk) disobey thee, say: Lo! I am innocent of what they  do. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_217"><span class=textnos>217</span><br>
And put thy trust in the Mighty, the Merciful. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_218"><span class=textnos>218</span><br>
Who seeth thee when thou standest up (to pray) </P>
<P><A NAME="026_219"><span class=textnos>219</span><br>
And (seeth) thine abasement among those who fall prostrate (in worship). </P>
<P><A NAME="026_220"><span class=textnos>220</span><br>
Lo! He, only He, is the Hearer, the Knower. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_221"><span class=textnos>221</span><br>
Shall I inform you upon whom the devils descend ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_222"><span class=textnos>222</span><br>
They descend on every sinful, false one. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_223"><span class=textnos>223</span><br>
They listen eagerly, but most of them are liars. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_224"><span class=textnos>224</span><br>
As for poets, the erring follow them. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_225"><span class=textnos>225</span><br>
Hast thou not seen how they stray in every valley, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_226"><span class=textnos>226</span><br>
And how they say that which they do not ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_227"><span class=textnos>227</span><br>
Save those who believe and do good works, and remember Allah much, and  vindicate themselves after they have been wronged. Those who do wrong will come  to know by what a (great) reverse they will be overturned!
