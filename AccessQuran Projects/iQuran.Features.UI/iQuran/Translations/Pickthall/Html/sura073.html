<P><A NAME="073_001"><span class=textnos>1</span><br>
O thou wrapped up in thy raiment! </P>
<P><A NAME="073_002"><span class=textnos>2</span><br>
Keep vigil the night long, save a little - </P>
<P><A NAME="073_003"><span class=textnos>3</span><br>
A half thereof, or abate a little thereof </P>
<P><A NAME="073_004"><span class=textnos>4</span><br>
Or add (a little) thereto - and chant the Qur'an in measure, </P>
<P><A NAME="073_005"><span class=textnos>5</span><br>
For we shall charge thee with a word of weight. </P>
<P><A NAME="073_006"><span class=textnos>6</span><br>
Lo! the vigil of the night is (a time) when impression is more keen and  speech more certain. </P>
<P><A NAME="073_007"><span class=textnos>7</span><br>
Lo! thou hast by day a chain of business. </P>
<P><A NAME="073_008"><span class=textnos>8</span><br>
So remember the name of thy Lord and devote thyself with a complete  devotion - </P>
<P><A NAME="073_009"><span class=textnos>9</span><br>
Lord of the East and the West; there is no God save Him; so choose thou  Him alone for thy defender - </P>
<P><A NAME="073_010"><span class=textnos>10</span><br>
And bear with patience what they utter, and part from them with a fair leave- taking. </P>
<P><A NAME="073_011"><span class=textnos>11</span><br>
Leave Me to deal with the deniers, lords of ease and comfort (in this life);  and do thou respite them awhile. </P>
<P><A NAME="073_012"><span class=textnos>12</span><br>
Lo! with Us are heavy fetters and a raging fire, </P>
<P><A NAME="073_013"><span class=textnos>13</span><br>
And food which choketh (the partaker), and a painful doom </P>
<P><A NAME="073_014"><span class=textnos>14</span><br>
On the day when the earth and the hills rock, and the hills become a heap of  running sand. </P>
<P><A NAME="073_015"><span class=textnos>15</span><br>
Lo! We have sent unto you a messenger as witness against you, even as We  sent unto Pharaoh a messenger. </P>
<P><A NAME="073_016"><span class=textnos>16</span><br>
But Pharaoh rebelled against the messenger, whereupon We seized him with  no gentle grip. </P>
<P><A NAME="073_017"><span class=textnos>17</span><br>
Then how, if ye disbelieve, will ye protect yourselves upon the day which  will turn children grey, </P>
<P><A NAME="073_018"><span class=textnos>18</span><br>
The very heaven being then rent asunder. His promise is to be fulfilled. </P>
<P><A NAME="073_019"><span class=textnos>19</span><br>
Lo! This is a Reminder. Let him who will, then, choose a way unto his Lord. </P>
<P><A NAME="073_020"><span class=textnos>20</span><br>
Lo! thy Lord knoweth how thou keepest vigil sometimes nearly two-thirds of  the night, or (sometimes) half or a third thereof, as do a party of those with thee.  Allah measureth the night and the day. He knoweth that ye count it not, and turneth  unto you in mercy. Recite, then, of the Qur'an that which is easy for you. He knoweth  that there are sick folk among you, while others travel in the land in search of Allah's  bounty, and others (still) are fighting for the cause of Allah. So recite of it that which  is easy (for you), and establish worship and pay the poor-due, and (so) lend unto  Allah a goodly loan. Whatsoever good ye send before you for your souls, ye will find  it with Allah, better and greater in the recompense. And seek forgiveness of Allah.  Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 
</P>
