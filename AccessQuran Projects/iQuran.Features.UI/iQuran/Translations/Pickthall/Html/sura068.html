<P><A NAME="068_001"><span class=textnos>1</span><br>
Nun. By the pen and that which they write (therewith), </P>
<P><A NAME="068_002"><span class=textnos>2</span><br>
Thou art not, for thy Lord's favour unto thee, a madman. </P>
<P><A NAME="068_003"><span class=textnos>3</span><br>
And lo! thine verily will be a reward unfailing. </P>
<P><A NAME="068_004"><span class=textnos>4</span><br>
And lo! thou art of a tremendous nature. </P>
<P><A NAME="068_005"><span class=textnos>5</span><br>
And thou wilt see and they will see </P>
<P><A NAME="068_006"><span class=textnos>6</span><br>
Which of you is the demented. </P>
<P><A NAME="068_007"><span class=textnos>7</span><br>
Lo! thy Lord is Best Aware of him who strayeth from His way, and He is  Best Aware of those who walk aright. </P>
<P><A NAME="068_008"><span class=textnos>8</span><br>
Therefor obey not thou the rejecters </P>
<P><A NAME="068_009"><span class=textnos>9</span><br>
Who would have had thee compromise, that they may compromise. </P>
<P><A NAME="068_010"><span class=textnos>10</span><br>
Neither obey thou each feeble oath-monger, </P>
<P><A NAME="068_011"><span class=textnos>11</span><br>
Detracter, spreader abroad of slanders, </P>
<P><A NAME="068_012"><span class=textnos>12</span><br>
Hinderer of the good, transgressor, malefactor </P>
<P><A NAME="068_013"><span class=textnos>13</span><br>
Greedy therewithal, intrusive. </P>
<P><A NAME="068_014"><span class=textnos>14</span><br>
It is because he is possessed of wealth and children </P>
<P><A NAME="068_015"><span class=textnos>15</span><br>
That, when Our revelations are recited unto him, he saith: Mere fables of the  men of old. </P>
<P><A NAME="068_016"><span class=textnos>16</span><br>
We shall brand him on the nose. </P>
<P><A NAME="068_017"><span class=textnos>17</span><br>
Lo! We have tried them as We tried the owners of the garden when they  vowed that they would pluck its fruit next morning, </P>
<P><A NAME="068_018"><span class=textnos>18</span><br>
And made no exception (for the Will of Allah); </P>
<P><A NAME="068_019"><span class=textnos>19</span><br>
Then a visitation from thy Lord came upon it while they slept </P>
<P><A NAME="068_020"><span class=textnos>20</span><br>
And in the morning it was as if plucked. </P>
<P><A NAME="068_021"><span class=textnos>21</span><br>
And they cried out one unto another in the morning, </P>
<P><A NAME="068_022"><span class=textnos>22</span><br>
Saying: Run unto your field if ye would pluck (the fruit). </P>
<P><A NAME="068_023"><span class=textnos>23</span><br>
So they went off, saying one unto another in low tones: </P>
<P><A NAME="068_024"><span class=textnos>24</span><br>
No needy man shall enter it to-day against you. </P>
<P><A NAME="068_025"><span class=textnos>25</span><br>
They went betimes, strong in (this) purpose. </P>
<P><A NAME="068_026"><span class=textnos>26</span><br>
But when they saw it, they said: Lo! we are in error! </P>
<P><A NAME="068_027"><span class=textnos>27</span><br>
Nay, but we are desolate! </P>

<P><A NAME="068_028"><span class=textnos>28</span><br>
The best among them said: Said I not unto you: Why glorify ye not (Allah) ? </P>
<P><A NAME="068_029"><span class=textnos>29</span><br>
They said: Glorified be our Lord! Lo! we have been wrong-doers. </P>
<P><A NAME="068_030"><span class=textnos>30</span><br>
Then some of them drew near unto others, self-reproaching. </P>
<P><A NAME="068_031"><span class=textnos>31</span><br>
They said: Alas for us! In truth we were outrageous. </P>
<P><A NAME="068_032"><span class=textnos>32</span><br>
It may be that our Lord will give us better than this in place thereof. Lo! we  beseech our Lord. </P>
<P><A NAME="068_033"><span class=textnos>33</span><br>
Such was the punishment. And verily the punishment of the Hereafter is  greater if they did but know. </P>
<P><A NAME="068_034"><span class=textnos>34</span><br>
Lo! for those who keep from evil are gardens of bliss with their Lord. </P>
<P><A NAME="068_035"><span class=textnos>35</span><br>
Shall We then treat those who have surrendered as We treat the guilty ? </P>
<P><A NAME="068_036"><span class=textnos>36</span><br>
What aileth you ? How foolishly ye judge! </P>
<P><A NAME="068_037"><span class=textnos>37</span><br>
Or have ye a scripture wherein ye learn </P>
<P><A NAME="068_038"><span class=textnos>38</span><br>
That ye shall indeed have all that ye choose ? </P>
<P><A NAME="068_039"><span class=textnos>39</span><br>
Or have ye a covenant on oath from Us that reacheth to the Day of Judgment,  that yours shall be all that ye ordain ? </P>
<P><A NAME="068_040"><span class=textnos>40</span><br>
Ask them (O Muhammad) which of them will vouch for that! </P>
<P><A NAME="068_041"><span class=textnos>41</span><br>
Or have they other gods ? Then let them bring their other gods if they are  truthful </P>
<P><A NAME="068_042"><span class=textnos>42</span><br>
On the day when it befalleth in earnest, and they are ordered to prostrate  themselves but are not able, </P>
<P><A NAME="068_043"><span class=textnos>43</span><br>
With eyes downcast, abasement stupefying them. And they had been  summoned to prostrate themselves while they were yet unhurt. </P>
<P><A NAME="068_044"><span class=textnos>44</span><br>
Leave Me (to deal) with those who give the lie to this pronouncement. We  shall lead them on by steps from whence they know not. </P>
<P><A NAME="068_045"><span class=textnos>45</span><br>
Yet I bear with them, for lo! My scheme is firm. </P>
<P><A NAME="068_046"><span class=textnos>46</span><br>
Or dost thou (Muhammad) ask a fee from them so that they are heavily taxed  ? </P>
<P><A NAME="068_047"><span class=textnos>47</span><br>
Or is the Unseen theirs that they can write (thereof) ? </P>
<P><A NAME="068_048"><span class=textnos>48</span><br>
But wait thou for thy Lord's decree, and be not like him of the fish, who cried  out in despair. </P>
<P><A NAME="068_049"><span class=textnos>49</span><br>
Had it not been that favour from his Lord had reached him he surely had  been cast into the wilderness while he was reprobate. </P>
<P><A NAME="068_050"><span class=textnos>50</span><br>
But his Lord chose him and placed him among the righteous. </P>
<P><A NAME="068_051"><span class=textnos>51</span><br>
And lo! those who disbelieve would fain disconcert thee with their eyes  when they hear the Reminder, and they say: Lo! he is indeed mad; </P>
<P><A NAME="068_052"><span class=textnos>52</span><br>
When it is naught else than a Reminder to creation. 
</P>
