<P><A NAME="015_001"><span class=textnos>1</span><br>
Alif. Lam. Ra. These are verses of the Scripture and a plain Reading. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_002"><span class=textnos>2</span><br>
It may be that those who disbelieve wish ardently that they were Muslims. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_003"><span class=textnos>3</span><br>
Let them eat and enjoy life, and let (false) hope beguile them. They will  come to know! </P>
<P><A NAME="015_004"><span class=textnos>4</span><br>
And We destroyed no township but there was a known decree for it. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_005"><span class=textnos>5</span><br>
No nation can outstrip its term nor can they lag behind. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_006"><span class=textnos>6</span><br>
And they say: O thou unto whom the Reminder is revealed, lo! thou art  indeed a madman! </P>
<P><A NAME="015_007"><span class=textnos>7</span><br>
Why bringest thou not angels unto us, if thou art of the truthful ? </P>
<P><A NAME="015_008"><span class=textnos>8</span><br>
We send not down the angels save with the Fact, and in that case (the  disbelievers) would not be tolerated. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_009"><span class=textnos>9</span><br>
Lo! We, even We, reveal the Reminder, and lo! We verily are its Guardian. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_010"><span class=textnos>10</span><br>
We verily sent (messengers) before thee among the factions of the men of  old. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_011"><span class=textnos>11</span><br>
And never came there unto them a messenger but they did mock him. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_012"><span class=textnos>12</span><br>
Thus do We make it traverse the hearts of the guilty: </P>
<P><A NAME="015_013"><span class=textnos>13</span><br>
They believe not therein, though the example of the men of old hath gone  before. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_014"><span class=textnos>14</span><br>
And even if We opened unto them a gate of heaven and they kept mounting  through it, </P>
<P><A NAME="015_015"><span class=textnos>15</span><br>
They would say: Our sight is wrong - nay, but we are folk bewitched. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_016"><span class=textnos>16</span><br>
And verily in the heaven we have set mansions of the stars, and We have  beautified it for beholders. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_017"><span class=textnos>17</span><br>
And We have guarded it from every outcast devil, </P>
<P><A NAME="015_018"><span class=textnos>18</span><br>
Save him who stealeth the hearing, and them doth a clear flame pursue. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_019"><span class=textnos>19</span><br>
And the earth have We spread out, and placed therein firm hills, and caused  each seemly thing to grow therein. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_020"><span class=textnos>20</span><br>
And we have given unto you livelihoods therein, and unto those for whom ye  provide not. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_021"><span class=textnos>21</span><br>
And there is not a thing but with Us are the stores thereof. And we send it not  down save in appointed measure. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_022"><span class=textnos>22</span><br>
And We send the winds fertilising, and cause water to descend from the sky,  and give it you to drink. It is not ye who are the holders of the store thereof. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_023"><span class=textnos>23</span><br>
Lo! and it is We, even We, Who quicken and give death, and We are the  Inheritor. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_024"><span class=textnos>24</span><br>
And verily We know the eager among you and verily We know the laggards. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_025"><span class=textnos>25</span><br>
Lo! thy Lord will gather them together. Lo! He is Wise, Aware. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_026"><span class=textnos>26</span><br>
Verily We created man of potter's clay of black mud altered, </P>
<P><A NAME="015_027"><span class=textnos>27</span><br>
And the jinn did We create aforetime of essential fire. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_028"><span class=textnos>28</span><br>
And (remember) when thy Lord said unto the angels: Lo! I am creating a  mortal out of potter's clay of black mud altered, </P>
<P><A NAME="015_029"><span class=textnos>29</span><br>
So, when I have made him and have breathed into him of My Spirit, do ye  fall down, prostrating yourselves unto him. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_030"><span class=textnos>30</span><br>
So the angels fell prostrate, all of them together </P>
<P><A NAME="015_031"><span class=textnos>31</span><br>
Save Iblis. He refused to be among the prostrate. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_032"><span class=textnos>32</span><br>
He said: O Iblis! What aileth thee that thou art not among the prostrate ? </P>
<P><A NAME="015_033"><span class=textnos>33</span><br>
He said: I am not one to prostrate myself unto a mortal whom Thou hast  created out of potter's clay of black mud altered! </P>
<P><A NAME="015_034"><span class=textnos>34</span><br>
He said: Then go thou forth from hence, for lo! thou art outcast. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_035"><span class=textnos>35</span><br>
And lo! the curse shall be upon thee till the Day of Judgment. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_036"><span class=textnos>36</span><br>
He said: My Lord! Reprieve me till the day when they are raised. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_037"><span class=textnos>37</span><br>
He said: Then lo! thou art of those reprieved </P>
<P><A NAME="015_038"><span class=textnos>38</span><br>
Till the Day of appointed time. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_039"><span class=textnos>39</span><br>
He said: My Lord! Because Thou hast sent me astray, I verily shall adorn the  path of error for them in the earth, and shall mislead them every one, </P>
<P><A NAME="015_040"><span class=textnos>40</span><br>
Save such of them as are Thy perfectly devoted slaves. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_041"><span class=textnos>41</span><br>
He said: This is a right course incumbent upon Me: </P>
<P><A NAME="015_042"><span class=textnos>42</span><br>
Lo! as for My slaves, thou hast no power over any of them save such of the  froward as follow thee, </P>
<P><A NAME="015_043"><span class=textnos>43</span><br>
And lo! for all such, hell will be the promised place. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_044"><span class=textnos>44</span><br>
It hath seven gates, and each gate hath an appointed portion. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_045"><span class=textnos>45</span><br>
Lo! those who ward off (evil) are among gardens and watersprings. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_046"><span class=textnos>46</span><br>
(And it is said unto them): Enter them in peace, secure. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_047"><span class=textnos>47</span><br>
And We remove whatever rancour may be in their breasts. As brethren, face  to face, (they rest) on couches raised. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_048"><span class=textnos>48</span><br>
Toil cometh not unto them there, nor will they be expelled from thence. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_049"><span class=textnos>49</span><br>
Announce, (O Muhammad) unto My slaves that verily I am the Forgiving,  the Merciful, </P>
<P><A NAME="015_050"><span class=textnos>50</span><br>
And that My doom is the dolorous doom. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_051"><span class=textnos>51</span><br>
And tell them of Abraham's guests, </P>
<P><A NAME="015_052"><span class=textnos>52</span><br>
(How) when they came in unto him, and said: Peace. He said: Lo! we are  afraid of you. </P>

<!--#include virtual="/table_middle.txt"-->


<P><A NAME="015_053"><span class=textnos>53</span><br>
They said: Be not afraid! Lo! we bring thee good tidings of a boy possessing  wisdom. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_054"><span class=textnos>54</span><br>
He said: Bring ye me good tidings (of a son) when old age hath overtaken me  ? Of what then can ye bring good tidings ? </P>
<P><A NAME="015_055"><span class=textnos>55</span><br>
They said: We bring thee good tidings in truth. So be not thou of the  despairing. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_056"><span class=textnos>56</span><br>
He said: And who despaireth of the mercy of his Lord save those who are  astray ? </P>
<P><A NAME="015_057"><span class=textnos>57</span><br>
He said: And afterward what is your business, O ye messengers (of Allah) ? </P>
<P><A NAME="015_058"><span class=textnos>58</span><br>
They said: We have been sent unto a guilty folk, </P>
<P><A NAME="015_059"><span class=textnos>59</span><br>
(All) save the family of Lot. Them we shall deliver every one, </P>
<P><A NAME="015_060"><span class=textnos>60</span><br>
Except his wife, of whom We had decreed that she should be of those who  stay behind. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_061"><span class=textnos>61</span><br>
And when the messengers came unto the family of Lot, </P>
<P><A NAME="015_062"><span class=textnos>62</span><br>
He said: Lo! ye are folk unknown (to me). </P>
<P><A NAME="015_063"><span class=textnos>63</span><br>
They said: Nay, but we bring thee that concerning which they keep  disputing, </P>
<P><A NAME="015_064"><span class=textnos>64</span><br>
And bring thee the Truth, and lo! we are truth-tellers. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_065"><span class=textnos>65</span><br>
So travel with thy household in a portion of the night, and follow thou their  backs. Let none of you turn round, but go whither ye are commanded. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_066"><span class=textnos>66</span><br>
And We made plain the case to him, that the root of them (who did wrong)  was to be cut at early morn. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_067"><span class=textnos>67</span><br>
And the people of the city came, rejoicing at the news (of new arrivals). </P>
<P><A NAME="015_068"><span class=textnos>68</span><br>
He said: Lo! they are my guests. Affront me not! </P>
<P><A NAME="015_069"><span class=textnos>69</span><br>
And keep your duty to Allah, and shame me not! </P>
<P><A NAME="015_070"><span class=textnos>70</span><br>
They said; Have we not forbidden you from (entertaining) anyone ? </P>
<P><A NAME="015_071"><span class=textnos>71</span><br>
He said: Here are my daughters, if ye must be doing (so). </P>
<P><A NAME="015_072"><span class=textnos>72</span><br>
By thy life (O Muhammad) they moved blindly in the frenzy of approaching  death. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_073"><span class=textnos>73</span><br>
Then the (Awful) Cry overtook them at the sunrise. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_074"><span class=textnos>74</span><br>
And We utterly confounded them, and We rained upon them stones of heated  clay. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_075"><span class=textnos>75</span><br>
Lo! therein verily are portents for those who read the signs. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_076"><span class=textnos>76</span><br>
And lo! it is upon a road still uneffaced. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_077"><span class=textnos>77</span><br>
Lo! therein is indeed a portent for believers. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_078"><span class=textnos>78</span><br>
And the dwellers in the wood indeed were evil-doers. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_079"><span class=textnos>79</span><br>
So we took vengeance on them; and lo! they both are on a high-road plain to  see. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_080"><span class=textnos>80</span><br>
And the dwellers in Al-Hijr denied (Our) messengers. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_081"><span class=textnos>81</span><br>
And we gave them Our revelations, but they were averse to them. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_082"><span class=textnos>82</span><br>
And they used to hew out dwellings from the hills, (wherein they dwelt)  secure. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_083"><span class=textnos>83</span><br>
But the (Awful) Cry overtook them at the morning hour, </P>
<P><A NAME="015_084"><span class=textnos>84</span><br>
And that which they were wont to count as gain availed them not. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_085"><span class=textnos>85</span><br>
We created not the heavens and the earth and all that is between them save  with truth, and lo! the Hour is surely coming. So forgive, (O Muhammad), with a  gracious forgiveness. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_086"><span class=textnos>86</span><br>
Lo! Thy Lord! He is the All-Wise Creator. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_087"><span class=textnos>87</span><br>
We have given thee seven of the oft-repeated (verses) and the great Qur'an. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_088"><span class=textnos>88</span><br>
Strain not thine eyes toward that which We cause some wedded pairs among  them to enjoin, and be not grieved on their account, and lower thy wing (in  tenderness) for the believers. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_089"><span class=textnos>89</span><br>
And say: Lo! I, even I, am a plain warner, </P>
<P><A NAME="015_090"><span class=textnos>90</span><br>
Such as We send down for those who make division, </P>
<P><A NAME="015_091"><span class=textnos>91</span><br>
Those who break the Qur'an into parts. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_092"><span class=textnos>92</span><br>
Them, by thy Lord, We shall question, every one, </P>
<P><A NAME="015_093"><span class=textnos>93</span><br>
Of what they used to do. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_094"><span class=textnos>94</span><br>
So proclaim that which thou art commanded, and withdraw from the  idolaters. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_095"><span class=textnos>95</span><br>
Lo! We defend thee from the scoffers, </P>
<P><A NAME="015_096"><span class=textnos>96</span><br>
Who set some other god along with Allah. But they will come to know. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_097"><span class=textnos>97</span><br>
Well know We that thy bosom is oppressed by what they say, </P>
<P><A NAME="015_098"><span class=textnos>98</span><br>
But hymn the praise of thy Lord, and be of those who make prostration (unto  Him). </P>
<P><A NAME="015_099"><span class=textnos>99</span><br>
And serve thy Lord till the Inevitable cometh unto thee. 
</P>
