<P><A NAME="072_001"><span class=textnos>1</span><br>
Say (O Muhammad): It is revealed unto me that a company of the Jinn gave  ear, and they said: Lo! we have heard a marvellous Qur'an, </P>
<P><A NAME="072_002"><span class=textnos>2</span><br>
Which guideth unto righteousness, so we believe in it and we ascribe no  partner unto our Lord. </P>
<P><A NAME="072_003"><span class=textnos>3</span><br>
And (we believe) that He - exalted be the glory of our Lord! - hath taken  neither wife nor son, </P>
<P><A NAME="072_004"><span class=textnos>4</span><br>
And that the foolish one among us used to speak concerning Allah an  atrocious lie. </P>
<P><A NAME="072_005"><span class=textnos>5</span><br>
And lo! we had supposed that humankind and jinn would not speak a lie  concerning Allah - </P>
<P><A NAME="072_006"><span class=textnos>6</span><br>
And indeed (O Muhammad) individuals of humankind used to invoke the  protection of individuals of the jinn, so that they increased them in revolt against  Allah); </P>
<P><A NAME="072_007"><span class=textnos>7</span><br>
And indeed they supposed, even as ye suppose, that Allah would not raise  anyone (from the dead) - </P>
<P><A NAME="072_008"><span class=textnos>8</span><br>
And (the Jinn who had listened to the Qur'an said): We had sought the  heaven but had found it filled with strong warders and meteors. </P>
<P><A NAME="072_009"><span class=textnos>9</span><br>
And we used to sit on places (high) therein to listen. But he who listeneth  now findeth a flame in wait for him; </P>
<P><A NAME="072_010"><span class=textnos>10</span><br>
And we know not whether harm is boded unto all who are in the earth, or  whether their Lord intendeth guidance for them. </P>
<P><A NAME="072_011"><span class=textnos>11</span><br>
And among us there are righteous folk and among us there are far from that.  We are sects having different rules. </P>
<P><A NAME="072_012"><span class=textnos>12</span><br>
And we know that we cannot escape from Allah in the earth, nor can we  escape by flight. </P>
<P><A NAME="072_013"><span class=textnos>13</span><br>
And when we heard the guidance, we believed therein, and whoso believeth  in his Lord, he feareth neither loss nor oppression. </P>

<P><A NAME="072_014"><span class=textnos>14</span><br>
And there are among us some who have surrendered (to Allah) and there are  among us some who are unjust. And whoso hath surrendered to Allah, such have  taken the right path purposefully. </P>
<P><A NAME="072_015"><span class=textnos>15</span><br>
And as for those who are unjust, they are firewood for hell. </P>
<P><A NAME="072_016"><span class=textnos>16</span><br>
If they (the idolaters) tread the right path, We shall give them to drink of  water in abundance </P>
<P><A NAME="072_017"><span class=textnos>17</span><br>
That We may test them thereby, and whoso turneth away from the  remembrance of his Lord; He will thrust him into ever-growing torment. </P>
<P><A NAME="072_018"><span class=textnos>18</span><br>
And the places of worship are only for Allah, so pray not unto anyone along  with Allah. </P>
<P><A NAME="072_019"><span class=textnos>19</span><br>
And when the slave of Allah stood up in prayer to Him, they crowded on  him, almost stifling. </P>
<P><A NAME="072_020"><span class=textnos>20</span><br>
Say (unto them, O Muhammad): I pray unto Allah only, and ascribe unto  Him no partner. </P>
<P><A NAME="072_021"><span class=textnos>21</span><br>
Say: Lo! I control not hurt nor benefit for you. </P>
<P><A NAME="072_022"><span class=textnos>22</span><br>
Say: Lo! none can protect me from Allah, nor can I find any refuge beside  Him </P>
<P><A NAME="072_023"><span class=textnos>23</span><br>
(Mine is) but conveyance (of the Truth) from Allah, and His messages; and  whoso disobeyeth Allah and His messenger, lo! his is fire of hell, wherein such dwell  for ever. </P>
<P><A NAME="072_024"><span class=textnos>24</span><br>
Till (the day) when they shall behold that which they are promised (they may  doubt); but then they will know (for certain) who is weaker in allies and less in  multitude. </P>
<P><A NAME="072_025"><span class=textnos>25</span><br>
Say (O Muhammad, unto the disbelievers): I know not whether that which ye  are promised is nigh, or if my Lord hath set a distant term for it. </P>
<P><A NAME="072_026"><span class=textnos>26</span><br>
(He is) the Knower of the Unseen, and He revealeth unto none His secret, </P>
<P><A NAME="072_027"><span class=textnos>27</span><br>
Save unto every messenger whom He hath chosen, and then He maketh a  guard to go before him and a guard behind him </P>
<P><A NAME="072_028"><span class=textnos>28</span><br>
That He may know that they have indeed conveyed the messages of their  Lord. He surroundeth all their doings, and He keepeth count of all things. 
</P>
