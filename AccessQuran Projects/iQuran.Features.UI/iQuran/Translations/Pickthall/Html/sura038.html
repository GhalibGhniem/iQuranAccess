<P><A NAME="038_001"><span class=textnos>1</span><br>
Sad. By the renowned Qur'an, </P>
<P><A NAME="038_002"><span class=textnos>2</span><br>
Nay, but those who disbelieve are in false pride and schism. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_003"><span class=textnos>3</span><br>
How many a generation We destroyed before them, and they cried out when  it was no longer the time for escape! </P>
<P><A NAME="038_004"><span class=textnos>4</span><br>
And they marvel that a warner from among themselves hath come unto them,  and the disbelievers say: This is a wizard, a charlatan. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_005"><span class=textnos>5</span><br>
Maketh he the gods One God ? Lo! that is an astounding thing. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_006"><span class=textnos>6</span><br>
The chiefs among them go about, exhorting: Go and be staunch to your gods!  Lo! this is a thing designed. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_007"><span class=textnos>7</span><br>
We have not heard of this in later religion. This is naught but an invention. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_008"><span class=textnos>8</span><br>
Hath the reminder been unto him (alone) among us ? Nay, but they are in  doubt concerning My reminder; nay but they have not yet tasted My doom. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_009"><span class=textnos>9</span><br>
Or are theirs the treasures of the mercy of thy Lord, the Mighty, the  Bestower ? </P>
<P><A NAME="038_010"><span class=textnos>10</span><br>
Or is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them  theirs ? Then let them ascend by ropes! </P>
<P><A NAME="038_011"><span class=textnos>11</span><br>
A defeated host are (all) the factions that are there. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_012"><span class=textnos>12</span><br>
The folk of Noah before them denied (their messenger) and (so did the tribe  of) A'ad, and Pharaoh firmly planted, </P>
<P><A NAME="038_013"><span class=textnos>13</span><br>
And (the tribe of) Thamud, and the folk of Lot, and the dwellers in the wood:  these were the factions. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_014"><span class=textnos>14</span><br>
Not one of them but did deny the messengers, therefor My doom was  justified, </P>
<P><A NAME="038_015"><span class=textnos>15</span><br>
These wait for but one Shout, there will be no second thereto. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_016"><span class=textnos>16</span><br>
They say: Our Lord! Hasten on for us our fate before the Day of Reckoning. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_017"><span class=textnos>17</span><br>
Bear with what they say, and remember Our bondman David, lord of might,  Lo! he was ever turning in repentance (toward Allah). </P>
<P><A NAME="038_018"><span class=textnos>18</span><br>
Lo! We subdued the hills to hymn the praises (of their Lord) with him at  nightfall and sunrise, </P>
<P><A NAME="038_019"><span class=textnos>19</span><br>
And the birds assembled; all were turning unto Him. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_020"><span class=textnos>20</span><br>
We made his kingdom strong and gave him wisdom and decisive speech. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_021"><span class=textnos>21</span><br>
And hath the story of the litigants come unto thee ? How they climbed the  wall into the royal chamber; </P>
<P><A NAME="038_022"><span class=textnos>22</span><br>
How they burst in upon David, and he was afraid of them. They said: Be not  afraid! (We are) two litigants, one of whom hath wronged the other, therefor judge  aright between us; be not unjust; and show us the fair way. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_023"><span class=textnos>23</span><br>
Lo! this my brother hath ninety and nine ewes while I had one ewe; and he  said: Entrust it to me, and he conquered me in speech. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_024"><span class=textnos>24</span><br>
(David) said: He hath wronged thee in demanding thine ewe in addition to  his ewes, and lo! many partners oppress one another, save such as believe and do  good works, and they are few. And David guessed that We had tried him, and he  sought forgiveness of his Lord, and he bowed himself and fell down prostrate and  repented. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_025"><span class=textnos>25</span><br>
So We forgave him that; and lo! he had access to Our presence and a happy  journey's end. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_026"><span class=textnos>26</span><br>
(And it was said unto him): O David! Lo! We have set thee as a viceroy in  the earth; therefor judge aright between mankind, and follow not desire that it beguile  thee from the way of Allah. Lo! those who wander from the way of Allah have an  awful doom, forasmuch as they forgot the Day of Reckoning. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_027"><span class=textnos>27</span><br>
And We created not the heaven and the earth and all that is between them in  vain. That is the opinion of those who disbelieve. And woe unto those who disbelieve,  from the Fire! </P>
<P><A NAME="038_028"><span class=textnos>28</span><br>
Shall We treat those who believe and do good works as those who spread  corruption in the earth; or shall We treat the pious as the wicked ? </P>
<P><A NAME="038_029"><span class=textnos>29</span><br>
(This is) a Scripture that We have revealed unto thee, full of blessing, that  they may ponder its revelations, and that men of understanding may reflect. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_030"><span class=textnos>30</span><br>
And We bestowed on David, Solomon. How excellent a slave! Lo! he was  ever turning in repentance (toward Allah). </P>
<P><A NAME="038_031"><span class=textnos>31</span><br>
When there were shown to him at eventide lightfooted coursers </P>
<P><A NAME="038_032"><span class=textnos>32</span><br>
And he said: Lo! I have preferred the good things (of the world) to the  remembrance of my Lord; till they were taken out of sight behind the curtain. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_033"><span class=textnos>33</span><br>
(Then he said): Bring them back to me, and fell to slashing (with his sword  their) legs and necks. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_034"><span class=textnos>34</span><br>
And verily We tried Solomon, and set upon his throne a (mere) body. Then  did he repent. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_035"><span class=textnos>35</span><br>
He said: My Lord! Forgive me and bestow on me sovereignty such as shall  not belong to any after me. Lo! Thou art the Bestower. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_036"><span class=textnos>36</span><br>
So We made the wind subservient unto him, setting fair by his command  whithersoever he intended. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_037"><span class=textnos>37</span><br>
And the unruly, every builder and diver (made We subservient), </P>
<P><A NAME="038_038"><span class=textnos>38</span><br>
And others linked together in chains, </P>
<P><A NAME="038_039"><span class=textnos>39</span><br>
(Saying): This is Our gift, so bestow thou, or withhold, without reckoning. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_040"><span class=textnos>40</span><br>
And lo! he hath favour with Us, and a happy journey's end. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_041"><span class=textnos>41</span><br>
And make mention (O Muhammad) of Our bondman Job, when he cried unto  his Lord (saying): Lo! the devil doth afflict me with distress and torment. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_042"><span class=textnos>42</span><br>
(And it was said unto him): Strike the ground with thy foot. This (spring) is a  cool bath and a refreshing drink. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_043"><span class=textnos>43</span><br>
And We bestowed on him (again) his household and therewith the like  thereof, a mercy from Us, and a memorial for men of understanding. </P>

<P><A NAME="038_044"><span class=textnos>44</span><br>
And (it was said unto him): Take in thine hand a branch and smite therewith,  and break not thine oath. Lo! We found him steadfast, how excellent a slave! Lo! he  was ever turning in repentance (to his Lord). </P>
<P><A NAME="038_045"><span class=textnos>45</span><br>
And make mention of Our bondmen, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, men of parts  and vision. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_046"><span class=textnos>46</span><br>
Lo! We purified them with a pure thought, remembrance of the Home (of the  Hereafter). </P>
<P><A NAME="038_047"><span class=textnos>47</span><br>
Lo! in Our sight they are verily of the elect, the excellent. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_048"><span class=textnos>48</span><br>
And make mention of Ishmael and Elisha and Dhu'l-Kifl. All are of the  chosen. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_049"><span class=textnos>49</span><br>
This is a reminder. And lo! for those who ward off (evil) is a happy journey's  end, </P>
<P><A NAME="038_050"><span class=textnos>50</span><br>
Gardens of Eden, whereof the gates are opened for them, </P>
<P><A NAME="038_051"><span class=textnos>51</span><br>
Wherein, reclining, they call for plenteous fruit and cool drink (that is)  therein. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_052"><span class=textnos>52</span><br>
And with them are those of modest gaze, companions. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_053"><span class=textnos>53</span><br>
This it is that ye are promised for the Day of Reckoning. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_054"><span class=textnos>54</span><br>
Lo! this in truth is Our provision, which will never waste away. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_055"><span class=textnos>55</span><br>
This (is for the righteous). And lo! for the transgressors there with be an evil  journey's end, </P>
<P><A NAME="038_056"><span class=textnos>56</span><br>
Hell, where they will burn, an evil resting-place. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_057"><span class=textnos>57</span><br>
Here is a boiling and an ice-cold draught, so let them taste it, </P>
<P><A NAME="038_058"><span class=textnos>58</span><br>
And other (torment) of the kind in pairs (the two extremes)! </P>
<P><A NAME="038_059"><span class=textnos>59</span><br>
Here is an army rushing blindly with you. (Those who are already in the Fire  say): No word of welcome for them. Lo! they will roast at the Fire. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_060"><span class=textnos>60</span><br>
They say: Nay, but you (misleaders), for you there is no word of welcome.  Ye prepared this for us (by your misleading). Now hapless is the plight. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_061"><span class=textnos>61</span><br>
They say: Our Lord! Whoever did prepare this for us, oh, give him double  portion of the Fire! </P>
<P><A NAME="038_062"><span class=textnos>62</span><br>
And they say: What aileth us that we behold not men whom we were wont to  count among the wicked ? </P>
<P><A NAME="038_063"><span class=textnos>63</span><br>
Did we take them (wrongly) for a laughing-stock, or have our eyes missed  them ? </P>
<P><A NAME="038_064"><span class=textnos>64</span><br>
Lo! that is very truth: the wrangling of the dwellers in the Fire. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_065"><span class=textnos>65</span><br>
Say (unto them, O Muhammad): I am only a warner, and there is no God  save Allah, the One, the Absolute, </P>
<P><A NAME="038_066"><span class=textnos>66</span><br>
Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, the Mighty,  the Pardoning. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_067"><span class=textnos>67</span><br>
Say: It is tremendous tidings </P>
<P><A NAME="038_068"><span class=textnos>68</span><br>
Whence ye turn away! </P>
<P><A NAME="038_069"><span class=textnos>69</span><br>
I had no knowledge of the Highest Chiefs when they disputed; </P>
<P><A NAME="038_070"><span class=textnos>70</span><br>
It is revealed unto me only that I may be a plain warner. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_071"><span class=textnos>71</span><br>
When thy Lord said unto the angels: Lo! I am about to create a mortal out of  mire, </P>
<P><A NAME="038_072"><span class=textnos>72</span><br>
And when I have fashioned him and breathed into him of My Spirit, then fall  down before him prostrate, </P>
<P><A NAME="038_073"><span class=textnos>73</span><br>
The angels fell down prostrate, every one, </P>
<P><A NAME="038_074"><span class=textnos>74</span><br>
Saving Iblis; he was scornful and became one of the disbelievers. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_075"><span class=textnos>75</span><br>
He said: O Iblis! What hindereth thee from falling prostrate before that which  I have created with both My hands ? Art thou too proud or art thou of the high exalted  ? </P>
<P><A NAME="038_076"><span class=textnos>76</span><br>
He said: I am better than him. Thou createdst me of fire, whilst him Thou  didst create of clay. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_077"><span class=textnos>77</span><br>
He said: Go forth from hence, for lo! thou art outcast, </P>
<P><A NAME="038_078"><span class=textnos>78</span><br>
And lo! My curse is on thee till the Day of Judgment. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_079"><span class=textnos>79</span><br>
He said: My Lord! Reprieve me till the day when they are raised. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_080"><span class=textnos>80</span><br>
He said: Lo! thou art of those reprieved </P>
<P><A NAME="038_081"><span class=textnos>81</span><br>
Until the day of the time appointed. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_082"><span class=textnos>82</span><br>
He said: Then, by Thy might, I surely will beguile them every one, </P>
<P><A NAME="038_083"><span class=textnos>83</span><br>
Save Thy single-minded slaves among them. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_084"><span class=textnos>84</span><br>
He said: The Truth is, and the Truth I speak, </P>
<P><A NAME="038_085"><span class=textnos>85</span><br>
That I shall fill hell with thee and with such of them as follow thee, together. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_086"><span class=textnos>86</span><br>
Say (O Muhammad, unto mankind): I ask of you no fee for this, and I am no  simulating. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_087"><span class=textnos>87</span><br>
Lo! it is naught else than a reminder for all peoples </P>
<P><A NAME="038_088"><span class=textnos>88</span><br>
And ye will come in time to know the truth thereof. 
</P>
