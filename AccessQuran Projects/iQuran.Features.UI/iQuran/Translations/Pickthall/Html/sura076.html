<P><A NAME="076_001"><span class=textnos>1</span><br>
Hath there come upon man (ever) any period of time in which he was a thing  unremembered ? </P>
<P><A NAME="076_002"><span class=textnos>2</span><br>
Lo! We create man from a drop of thickened fluid to test him; so We make  him hearing, knowing. </P>
<P><A NAME="076_003"><span class=textnos>3</span><br>
Lo! We have shown him the way, whether he be grateful or disbelieving. </P>
<P><A NAME="076_004"><span class=textnos>4</span><br>
Lo! We have prepared for disbelievers manacles and carcans and a raging  fire. </P>
<P><A NAME="076_005"><span class=textnos>5</span><br>
Lo! the righteous shall drink of a cup whereof the mixture is of Kafur, </P>
<P><A NAME="076_006"><span class=textnos>6</span><br>
A spring wherefrom the slaves of Allah drink, making it gush forth  abundantly, </P>
<P><A NAME="076_007"><span class=textnos>7</span><br>
(Because) they perform the vow and fear a day whereof the evil is wide- spreading, </P>
<P><A NAME="076_008"><span class=textnos>8</span><br>
And feed with food the needy wretch, the orphan and the prisoner, for love  of Him, </P>
<P><A NAME="076_009"><span class=textnos>9</span><br>
(Saying): We feed you, for the sake of Allah only. We wish for no reward  nor thanks from you; </P>
<P><A NAME="076_010"><span class=textnos>10</span><br>
Lo! we fear from our Lord a day of frowning and of fate. </P>
<P><A NAME="076_011"><span class=textnos>11</span><br>
Therefor Allah hath warded off from them the evil of that day, and hath  made them find brightness and joy; </P>
<P><A NAME="076_012"><span class=textnos>12</span><br>
And hath awarded them for all that they endured, a Garden and silk attire; </P>
<P><A NAME="076_013"><span class=textnos>13</span><br>
Reclining therein upon couches, they will find there neither (heat of) a sun  nor bitter cold. </P>
<P><A NAME="076_014"><span class=textnos>14</span><br>
The shade thereof is close upon them and the clustered fruits thereof bow  down. </P>
<P><A NAME="076_015"><span class=textnos>15</span><br>
Goblets of silver are brought round for them, and beakers (as) of glass </P>

<!--#include virtual="/table_middle.txt"-->


<P><A NAME="076_016"><span class=textnos>16</span><br>
(Bright as) glass but (made) of silver, which they (themselves) have  measured to the measure (of their deeds). </P>
<P><A NAME="076_017"><span class=textnos>17</span><br>
There are they watered with a cup whereof the mixture is of Zanjabil, </P>
<P><A NAME="076_018"><span class=textnos>18</span><br>
(The water of) a spring therein, named Salsabil. </P>
<P><A NAME="076_019"><span class=textnos>19</span><br>
There wait on them immortal youths, whom, when thou seest, thou wouldst  take for scattered pearls. </P>
<P><A NAME="076_020"><span class=textnos>20</span><br>
When thou seest, thou wilt see there bliss and high estate. </P>
<P><A NAME="076_021"><span class=textnos>21</span><br>
Their raiment will be fine green silk and gold embroidery. Bracelets of silver  will they wear. Their Lord will slake their thirst with a pure drink. </P>
<P><A NAME="076_022"><span class=textnos>22</span><br>
(And it will be said unto them): Lo! this is a reward for you. Your endeavour  (upon earth) hath found acceptance. </P>
<P><A NAME="076_023"><span class=textnos>23</span><br>
Lo! We, even We, have revealed unto thee the Qur'an, a revelation; </P>
<P><A NAME="076_024"><span class=textnos>24</span><br>
So submit patiently to thy Lord's command, and obey not of them any guilty  one or disbeliever. </P>
<P><A NAME="076_025"><span class=textnos>25</span><br>
Remember the name of thy Lord at morn and evening. </P>
<P><A NAME="076_026"><span class=textnos>26</span><br>
And worship Him (a portion) of the night. And glorify Him through the  livelong night. </P>
<P><A NAME="076_027"><span class=textnos>27</span><br>
Lo! these love fleeting life, and put behind them (the remembrance of) a  grievous day. </P>
<P><A NAME="076_028"><span class=textnos>28</span><br>
We, even We, created them, and strengthened their frame. And when We  will, We can replace them, bringing others like them in their stead. </P>
<P><A NAME="076_029"><span class=textnos>29</span><br>
Lo! this is an Admonishment, that whosoever will may choose a way unto  his Lord. </P>
<P><A NAME="076_030"><span class=textnos>30</span><br>
Yet ye will not, unless Allah willeth. Lo! Allah is Knower, Wise. </P>
<P><A NAME="076_031"><span class=textnos>31</span><br>
He maketh whom He will to enter His mercy, and for evil-doers hath  prepared a painful doom. 
</P>
