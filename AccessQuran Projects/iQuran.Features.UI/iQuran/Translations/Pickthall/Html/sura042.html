<P><A NAME="042_001"><span class=textnos>1</span><br>
Ha. Mim. </P>
<P><A NAME="042_002"><span class=textnos>2</span><br>
A'in. Sin. Qaf. </P>
<P><A NAME="042_003"><span class=textnos>3</span><br>
Thus Allah the Mighty, the Knower inspireth thee (Muhammad) as (He  inspired) those before thee. </P>
<P><A NAME="042_004"><span class=textnos>4</span><br>
Unto Him belongeth all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth, and  He is the Sublime, the Tremendous. </P>
<P><A NAME="042_005"><span class=textnos>5</span><br>
Almost might the heavens above be rent asunder while the angels hymn the  praise of their Lord and ask forgiveness for those on the earth. Lo! Allah, He is the  Forgiver, the Merciful. </P>
<P><A NAME="042_006"><span class=textnos>6</span><br>
And as for those who choose protecting friends beside Him, Allah is Warden  over them, and thou art in no wise a guardian over them. </P>
<P><A NAME="042_007"><span class=textnos>7</span><br>
And thus We have inspired in thee a Lecture in Arabic, that thou mayst warn  the mother-town and those around it, and mayst warn of a day of assembling whereof  there is no doubt. A host will be in the Garden, and a host of them in the Flame. </P>
<P><A NAME="042_008"><span class=textnos>8</span><br>
Had Allah willed, He could have made them one community, but Allah  bringeth whom He will into His mercy. And the wrong-doers have no friend nor  helper. </P>
<P><A NAME="042_009"><span class=textnos>9</span><br>
Or have they chosen protecting friends besides Him ? But Allah, He (alone)  is the Protecting Friend. He quickeneth the dead, and He is Able to do all things. </P>
<P><A NAME="042_010"><span class=textnos>10</span><br>
And in whatsoever ye differ, the verdict therein belongeth to Allah. Such is  my Lord, in Whom I put my trust, and unto Whom I turn. </P>
<P><A NAME="042_011"><span class=textnos>11</span><br>
The Creator of the heavens and the earth. He hath made for you pairs of  yourselves, and of the cattle also pairs, whereby He multiplieth you. Naught is as His  likeness; and He is the Hearer, the Seer. </P>
<P><A NAME="042_012"><span class=textnos>12</span><br>
His are the keys of the heavens and the earth. He enlargeth providence for  whom He will and straiteneth (it for whom He will). Lo! He is Knower of all things. </P>
<P><A NAME="042_013"><span class=textnos>13</span><br>
He hath ordained for you that religion which He commended unto Noah, and  that which We inspire in thee (Muhammad), and that which We commended unto  Abraham and Moses and Jesus, saying: Establish the religion, and be not divided  therein. Dreadful for the idolaters is that unto which thou callest them. Allah chooseth  for Himself whom He will, and guideth unto Himself him who turneth (toward Him). </P>
<P><A NAME="042_014"><span class=textnos>14</span><br>
And they were not divided until after the knowledge came unto them,  through rivalry among themselves; and had it not been for a Word that had already  gone forth from thy Lord for an appointed term, it surely had been judged between  them. And those who were made to inherit the Scripture after them are verily in  hopeless doubt concerning it. </P>
<P><A NAME="042_015"><span class=textnos>15</span><br>
Unto this, then, summon (O Muhammad). And be thou upright as thou art  commanded, and follow not their lusts, but say: I believe in whatever scripture Allah  hath sent down, and I am commanded to be just among you. Allah is our Lord and  your Lord. Unto us our works and unto you your works; no argument between us and  you. Allah will bring us together, and unto Him is the journeying. </P>
<P><A NAME="042_016"><span class=textnos>16</span><br>
And those who argue concerning Allah after He hath been acknowledged,  their argument hath no weight with their Lord, and wrath is upon them and theirs will  be an awful doom. </P>
<P><A NAME="042_017"><span class=textnos>17</span><br>
Allah it is Who hath revealed the Scripture with truth, and the Balance. How  canst thou know ? It may be that the Hour is nigh. </P>
<P><A NAME="042_018"><span class=textnos>18</span><br>
Those who believe not therein seek to hasten it, while those who believe are  fearful of it and know that it is the Truth. Are not they who dispute, in doubt  concerning the Hour, far astray ? </P>
<P><A NAME="042_019"><span class=textnos>19</span><br>
Allah is gracious unto His slaves. He provideth for whom He will. And He is  the Strong, the Mighty. </P>
<P><A NAME="042_020"><span class=textnos>20</span><br>
Whoso desireth the harvest of the Hereafter, We give him increase in its  harvest. And whoso desireth the harvest of the world, We give him thereof, and he  hath no portion in the Hereafter. </P>
<P><A NAME="042_021"><span class=textnos>21</span><br>
Or have they partners (of Allah) who have made lawful for them in religion  that which Allah allowed not ? And but for a decisive word (gone forth already), it  would have been judged between them. Lo! for wrong-doers is a painful doom. </P>
<P><A NAME="042_022"><span class=textnos>22</span><br>
Thou seest the wrong-doers fearful of that which they have earned, and it  will surely befall them, while those who believe and do good works (will be) in  flowering meadows of the Gardens, having what they wish from their Lord. This is  the great preferment. </P>
<P><A NAME="042_023"><span class=textnos>23</span><br>
This it is which Allah announceth unto His bondmen who believe and do  good works. Say (O Muhammad, unto mankind): I ask of you no fee therefor, save  lovingkindness among kinsfolk. And whoso scoreth a good deed We add unto its  good for him. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Responsive. </P>
<P><A NAME="042_024"><span class=textnos>24</span><br>
Or say they: He hath invented a lie concerning Allah ? If Allah willed, He  could have sealed thy heart (against them). And Allah will wipe out the lie and will  vindicate the truth by His words. Lo! He is Aware of what is hidden in the breasts (of  men). </P>
<P><A NAME="042_025"><span class=textnos>25</span><br>
And He it is Who accepteth repentance from His bondmen, and pardoneth  the evil deeds, and knoweth what ye do, </P>
<P><A NAME="042_026"><span class=textnos>26</span><br>
And accepteth those who do good works, and giveth increase unto them of  His bounty. And as for disbelievers, theirs will be an awful doom. </P>
<P><A NAME="042_027"><span class=textnos>27</span><br>
And if Allah were to enlarge the provision for His slaves they would surely  rebel in the earth, but He sendeth down by measure as He willeth. Lo! He is  Informed, a Seer of His bondmen. </P>

<P><A NAME="042_028"><span class=textnos>28</span><br>
And He it is Who sendeth down the saving rain after they have despaired,  and spreadeth out His mercy. He is the Protecting Friend, the Praiseworthy. </P>
<P><A NAME="042_029"><span class=textnos>29</span><br>
And of His portents is the creation of the heaven and the earth, and of  whatever beasts He hath dispersed therein. And He is Able to gather them when He  will. </P>
<P><A NAME="042_030"><span class=textnos>30</span><br>
Whatever of misfortune striketh you, it is what your right hands have earned.  And He forgiveth much. </P>
<P><A NAME="042_031"><span class=textnos>31</span><br>
Ye cannot escape in the earth, for beside Allah ye have no protecting friend  nor any helper. </P>
<P><A NAME="042_032"><span class=textnos>32</span><br>
And of His portents are the ships, like banners on the sea; </P>
<P><A NAME="042_033"><span class=textnos>33</span><br>
If He will He calmeth the wind so that they keep still upon its surface - Lo!  herein verily are signs for every steadfast grateful (heart). - </P>
<P><A NAME="042_034"><span class=textnos>34</span><br>
Or He causeth them to perish on account of that which they have earned -  And He forgiveth much - </P>
<P><A NAME="042_035"><span class=textnos>35</span><br>
And that those who argue concerning Our revelations may know they have  no refuge. </P>
<P><A NAME="042_036"><span class=textnos>36</span><br>
Now whatever ye have been given is but a passing comfort for the life of the  world, and that which Allah hath is better and more lasting for those who believe and  put their trust in their Lord, </P>
<P><A NAME="042_037"><span class=textnos>37</span><br>
And those who shun the worst of sins and indecencies and, when they are  wroth, forgive, </P>
<P><A NAME="042_038"><span class=textnos>38</span><br>
And those who answer the call of their Lord and establish worship, and  whose affairs are a matter of counsel, and who spend of what We have bestowed on  them, </P>
<P><A NAME="042_039"><span class=textnos>39</span><br>
And those who, when great wrong is done to them, defend themselves, </P>
<P><A NAME="042_040"><span class=textnos>40</span><br>
The guerdon of an ill-deed is an ill the like thereof. But whosoever pardoneth  and amendeth, his wage is the affair of Allah. Lo! He loveth not wrong-doers. </P>
<P><A NAME="042_041"><span class=textnos>41</span><br>
And whoso defendeth himself after he hath suffered wrong - for such, there  is no way (of blame) against them. </P>
<P><A NAME="042_042"><span class=textnos>42</span><br>
The way (of blame) is only against those who oppress mankind, and  wrongfully rebel in the earth. For such there is a painful doom. </P>
<P><A NAME="042_043"><span class=textnos>43</span><br>
And verily whoso is patient and forgiveth - lo! that, verily, is (of) the  steadfast heart of things. </P>
<P><A NAME="042_044"><span class=textnos>44</span><br>
He whom Allah sendeth astray, for him there is no protecting friend after  Him. And thou (Muhammad) wilt see the evil-doers when they see the doom, (how)  they say: Is there any way of return ? </P>
<P><A NAME="042_045"><span class=textnos>45</span><br>
And thou wilt see them exposed to (the Fire), made humble by disgrace, and  looking with veiled eyes. And those who believe will say: Lo! the (eternal) losers are  they who lose themselves and their housefolk on the Day of Resurrection. Lo! are not  the wrong-doers in perpetual torment ? </P>
<P><A NAME="042_046"><span class=textnos>46</span><br>
And they will have no protecting friends to help them instead of Allah. He  whom Allah sendeth astray, for him there is no road. </P>
<P><A NAME="042_047"><span class=textnos>47</span><br>
Answer the call of your Lord before there cometh unto you from Allah a Day  which there is no averting. Ye have no refuge on that Day, nor have a ye any (power  of) refusal. </P>
<P><A NAME="042_048"><span class=textnos>48</span><br>
But if they are averse, We have not sent thee as a warder over them. Thine is  only to convey (the message). And lo! when We cause man to taste of mercy from Us  he exulteth therefor. And if some evil striketh them because of that which their own  hands have sent before, then lo! man is an ingrate. </P>
<P><A NAME="042_049"><span class=textnos>49</span><br>
Unto Allah belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth. He  createth what He will. He bestoweth female (offspring) upon whom He will, and  bestoweth male (offspring) upon whom He will; </P>
<P><A NAME="042_050"><span class=textnos>50</span><br>
Or He mingleth them, males and females, and He maketh barren whom He  will. Lo! He is Knower, Powerful. </P>
<P><A NAME="042_051"><span class=textnos>51</span><br>
And it was not (vouchsafed) to any mortal that Allah should speak to him  unless (it be) by revelation or from behind a veil, or (that) He sendeth a messenger to  reveal what He will by His leave. Lo! He is Exalted, Wise. </P>
<P><A NAME="042_052"><span class=textnos>52</span><br>
And thus have We inspired in thee (Muhammad) a Spirit of Our command.  Thou knewest not what the Scripture was, nor what the Faith. But We have made it a  light whereby We guide whom We will of Our bondmen. And lo! thou verily dost  guide unto a right path, </P>
<P><A NAME="042_053"><span class=textnos>53</span><br>
The path of Allah, unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and  whatsoever is in the earth. Do not all things reach Allah at last ? 
</P>
