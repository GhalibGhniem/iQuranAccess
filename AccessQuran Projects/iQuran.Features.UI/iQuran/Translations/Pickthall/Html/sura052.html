<P><A NAME="052_001"><span class=textnos>1</span><br>
By the Mount, </P>
<P><A NAME="052_002"><span class=textnos>2</span><br>
And a Scripture inscribed </P>
<P><A NAME="052_003"><span class=textnos>3</span><br>
On fine parchment unrolled, </P>
<P><A NAME="052_004"><span class=textnos>4</span><br>
And the House frequented, </P>
<P><A NAME="052_005"><span class=textnos>5</span><br>
And the roof exalted, </P>
<P><A NAME="052_006"><span class=textnos>6</span><br>
And the sea kept filled, </P>
<P><A NAME="052_007"><span class=textnos>7</span><br>
Lo! the doom of thy Lord will surely come to pass; </P>
<P><A NAME="052_008"><span class=textnos>8</span><br>
There is none that can ward it off. </P>
<P><A NAME="052_009"><span class=textnos>9</span><br>
On the day when the heaven will heave with (awful) heaving, </P>
<P><A NAME="052_010"><span class=textnos>10</span><br>
And the mountains move away with (awful) movement, </P>
<P><A NAME="052_011"><span class=textnos>11</span><br>
Then woe that day unto the deniers </P>
<P><A NAME="052_012"><span class=textnos>12</span><br>
Who play in talk of grave matters; </P>
<P><A NAME="052_013"><span class=textnos>13</span><br>
The day when they are thrust with a (disdainful) thrust, into the fire of hell </P>
<P><A NAME="052_014"><span class=textnos>14</span><br>
(And it is said unto them): This is the Fire which ye were wont to deny. </P>
<P><A NAME="052_015"><span class=textnos>15</span><br>
Is this magic, or do ye not see ? </P>
<P><A NAME="052_016"><span class=textnos>16</span><br>
Endure the heat thereof, and whether ye are patient of it or impatient of it is  all one for you. Ye are only being paid for what ye used to do. </P>
<P><A NAME="052_017"><span class=textnos>17</span><br>
Lo! those who kept their duty dwell in gardens and delight, </P>
<P><A NAME="052_018"><span class=textnos>18</span><br>
Happy because of what their Lord hath given them, and (because) their Lord  hath warded off from them the torment of hell-fire. </P>
<P><A NAME="052_019"><span class=textnos>19</span><br>
(And it is said unto them): Eat and drink in health (as a reward) for what ye  used to do, </P>
<P><A NAME="052_020"><span class=textnos>20</span><br>
Reclining on ranged couches. And we wed them unto fair ones with wide,  lovely eyes. </P>
<P><A NAME="052_021"><span class=textnos>21</span><br>
And they who believe and whose seed follow them in faith, We cause their  seed to join them (there), and We deprive them of nought of their (life's) work. Every  man is a pledge for that which he hath earned. </P>
<P><A NAME="052_022"><span class=textnos>22</span><br>
And We provide them with fruit and meat such as they desire. </P>
<P><A NAME="052_023"><span class=textnos>23</span><br>
There they pass from hand to hand a cup wherein is neither vanity nor cause  of sin. </P>
<P><A NAME="052_024"><span class=textnos>24</span><br>
And there go round, waiting on them menservants of their own, as they were  hidden pearls. </P>
<P><A NAME="052_025"><span class=textnos>25</span><br>
And some of them draw near unto others, questioning, </P>

<P><A NAME="052_026"><span class=textnos>26</span><br>
Saying: Lo! of old, when we were with our families, we were ever anxious; </P>
<P><A NAME="052_027"><span class=textnos>27</span><br>
But Allah hath been gracious unto us and hath preserved us from the torment  of the breath of Fire. </P>
<P><A NAME="052_028"><span class=textnos>28</span><br>
Lo! we used to pray unto Him of old. Lo! He is the Benign, the Merciful. </P>
<P><A NAME="052_029"><span class=textnos>29</span><br>
Therefor warn (men, O Muhammad). By the grace of Allah thou art neither  soothsayer nor madman. </P>
<P><A NAME="052_030"><span class=textnos>30</span><br>
Or say they: (he is) a poet, (one) for whom we may expect the accident of  time ? </P>
<P><A NAME="052_031"><span class=textnos>31</span><br>
Say (unto them): Except (your fill)! Lo! I am with you among the expectant. </P>
<P><A NAME="052_032"><span class=textnos>32</span><br>
Do their minds command them to do this, or are they an outrageous folk ? </P>
<P><A NAME="052_033"><span class=textnos>33</span><br>
Or say they: He hath invented it ? Nay, but they will not believe! </P>
<P><A NAME="052_034"><span class=textnos>34</span><br>
Then let them produce speech the like thereof, if they are truthful. </P>
<P><A NAME="052_035"><span class=textnos>35</span><br>
Or were they created out of naught ? Or are they the creators ? </P>
<P><A NAME="052_036"><span class=textnos>36</span><br>
Or did they create the heavens and the earth ? Nay, but they are sure of  nothing! </P>
<P><A NAME="052_037"><span class=textnos>37</span><br>
Or do they own the treasures of thy Lord ? Or have they been given charge  (thereof) ? </P>
<P><A NAME="052_038"><span class=textnos>38</span><br>
Or have they any stairway (unto heaven) by means of which they overhear  (decrees). Then let their listener produce some warrant manifest! </P>
<P><A NAME="052_039"><span class=textnos>39</span><br>
Or hath He daughters whereas ye have sons ? </P>
<P><A NAME="052_040"><span class=textnos>40</span><br>
Or askest thou (Muhammad) a fee from them so that they are plunged in debt  ? </P>
<P><A NAME="052_041"><span class=textnos>41</span><br>
Or possess they the Unseen so that they can write (it) down ? </P>
<P><A NAME="052_042"><span class=textnos>42</span><br>
Or seek they to ensnare (the messenger) ? But those who disbelieve, they are  the ensnared! </P>
<P><A NAME="052_043"><span class=textnos>43</span><br>
Or have they any god beside Allah ? Glorified be Allah from all that they  ascribe as partner (unto Him)! </P>
<P><A NAME="052_044"><span class=textnos>44</span><br>
And if they were to see a fragment of the heaven falling, they would say: A  heap of clouds. </P>
<P><A NAME="052_045"><span class=textnos>45</span><br>
Then let them be (O Muhammad), till they meet their day, in which they will  be thunder-stricken, </P>
<P><A NAME="052_046"><span class=textnos>46</span><br>
A day in which their guile will naught avail them, nor will they be helped. </P>
<P><A NAME="052_047"><span class=textnos>47</span><br>
And verily, for those who do wrong, there is a punishment beyond that. But  most of them know not. </P>
<P><A NAME="052_048"><span class=textnos>48</span><br>
So wait patiently (O Muhammad) for thy Lord's decree, for surely thou art in  Our sight; and hymn the praise of thy Lord when thou uprisest, </P>
<P><A NAME="052_049"><span class=textnos>49</span><br>
And in the night-time also hymn His praise, and at the setting of the stars. 
</P>
