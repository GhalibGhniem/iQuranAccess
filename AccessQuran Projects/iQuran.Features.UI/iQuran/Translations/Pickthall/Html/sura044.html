<P><A NAME="044_001"><span class=textnos>1</span><br>
Ha. Mim. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_002"><span class=textnos>2</span><br>
By the Scripture that maketh plain </P>
<P><A NAME="044_003"><span class=textnos>3</span><br>
Lo! We revealed it on a blessed night - Lo! We are ever warning - </P>
<P><A NAME="044_004"><span class=textnos>4</span><br>
Whereon every wise command is made clear </P>
<P><A NAME="044_005"><span class=textnos>5</span><br>
As a command from Our presence - Lo! We are ever sending - </P>
<P><A NAME="044_006"><span class=textnos>6</span><br>
A mercy from thy Lord. Lo! He, even He is the Hearer, the Knower, </P>
<P><A NAME="044_007"><span class=textnos>7</span><br>
Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, if ye would  be sure. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_008"><span class=textnos>8</span><br>
There is no God save Him. He quickeneth and giveth death; your Lord and  Lord of your forefathers. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_009"><span class=textnos>9</span><br>
Nay, but they play in doubt. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_010"><span class=textnos>10</span><br>
But watch thou (O Muhammad) for the day when the sky will produce  visible smoke </P>
<P><A NAME="044_011"><span class=textnos>11</span><br>
That will envelop the people. This will be a painful torment. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_012"><span class=textnos>12</span><br>
(Then they will say): Our Lord relieve us of the torment. Lo! we are  believers. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_013"><span class=textnos>13</span><br>
How can there be remembrance for them, when a messenger making plain  (the Truth) had already come unto them, </P>
<P><A NAME="044_014"><span class=textnos>14</span><br>
And they had turned away from him and said: One taught (by others), a  madman ? </P>
<P><A NAME="044_015"><span class=textnos>15</span><br>
Lo! We withdraw the torment a little. Lo! ye return (to disbelief). </P>
<P><A NAME="044_016"><span class=textnos>16</span><br>
On the day when We shall seize them with the greater seizure, (then) in truth  We shall punish. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_017"><span class=textnos>17</span><br>
And verily We tried before them Pharaoh's folk, when there came unto them  a noble messenger, </P>
<P><A NAME="044_018"><span class=textnos>18</span><br>
Saying: Give up to me the slaves of Allah. Lo! I am a faithful messenger  unto you. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_019"><span class=textnos>19</span><br>
And saying: Be not proud against Allah. Lo! I bring you a clear warrant. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_020"><span class=textnos>20</span><br>
And lo! I have sought refuge in my Lord and your Lord lest ye stone me to  death. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_021"><span class=textnos>21</span><br>
And if ye put no faith in me, then let me go. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_022"><span class=textnos>22</span><br>
And he cried unto his Lord, (saying): These are guilty folk. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_023"><span class=textnos>23</span><br>
Then (his Lord commanded): Take away My slaves by night. Lo! ye will be  followed, </P>
<P><A NAME="044_024"><span class=textnos>24</span><br>
And leave the sea behind at rest, for lo! they are a drowned host. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_025"><span class=textnos>25</span><br>
How many were the gardens and the watersprings that they left behind, </P>
<P><A NAME="044_026"><span class=textnos>26</span><br>
And the cornlands and the goodly sites </P>
<P><A NAME="044_027"><span class=textnos>27</span><br>
And pleasant things wherein they took delight! </P>
<P><A NAME="044_028"><span class=textnos>28</span><br>
Even so (it was), and We made it an inheritance for other folk; </P>
<P><A NAME="044_029"><span class=textnos>29</span><br>
And the heaven and the earth wept not for them, nor were they reprieved. </P>

<P><A NAME="044_030"><span class=textnos>30</span><br>
And We delivered the Children of Israel from the shameful doom; </P>
<P><A NAME="044_031"><span class=textnos>31</span><br>
(We delivered them) from Pharaoh. Lo! he was a tyrant of the wanton ones. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_032"><span class=textnos>32</span><br>
And We chose them, purposely, above (all) creatures. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_033"><span class=textnos>33</span><br>
And We gave them portents wherein was a clear trial. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_034"><span class=textnos>34</span><br>
Lo! these, forsooth, are saying: </P>
<P><A NAME="044_035"><span class=textnos>35</span><br>
There is naught but our first death, and we shall not be raised again. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_036"><span class=textnos>36</span><br>
Bring back our fathers, if ye speak the truth! </P>
<P><A NAME="044_037"><span class=textnos>37</span><br>
Are they better, or the folk of Tubb'a and those before them ? We destroyed  them, for surely they were guilty. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_038"><span class=textnos>38</span><br>
And We created not the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them,  in play. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_039"><span class=textnos>39</span><br>
We created them not save with truth; but most of them know not. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_040"><span class=textnos>40</span><br>
Assuredly the Day of Decision is the term for all of them, </P>
<P><A NAME="044_041"><span class=textnos>41</span><br>
A day when friend can in naught avail friend, nor can they be helped, </P>
<P><A NAME="044_042"><span class=textnos>42</span><br>
Save him on whom Allah hath mercy. Lo! He is the Mighty, the Merciful. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_043"><span class=textnos>43</span><br>
Lo! the tree of Zaqqum, </P>
<P><A NAME="044_044"><span class=textnos>44</span><br>
The food of the sinner! </P>
<P><A NAME="044_045"><span class=textnos>45</span><br>
Like molten brass, it seetheth in their bellies </P>
<P><A NAME="044_046"><span class=textnos>46</span><br>
As the seething of boiling water. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_047"><span class=textnos>47</span><br>
(And it will be said): Take him and drag him to the midst of hell, </P>
<P><A NAME="044_048"><span class=textnos>48</span><br>
Then pour upon his head the torment of boiling water. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_049"><span class=textnos>49</span><br>
(Saying): Taste! Lo! thou wast forsooth the mighty, the noble! </P>
<P><A NAME="044_050"><span class=textnos>50</span><br>
Lo! this is that whereof ye used to doubt. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_051"><span class=textnos>51</span><br>
Lo! those who kept their duty will be in a place secured. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_052"><span class=textnos>52</span><br>
Amid gardens and watersprings, </P>
<P><A NAME="044_053"><span class=textnos>53</span><br>
Attired in silk and silk embroidery, facing one another. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_054"><span class=textnos>54</span><br>
Even so (it will be). And We shall wed them unto fair ones with wide, lovely  eyes. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_055"><span class=textnos>55</span><br>
They call therein for every fruit in safety. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_056"><span class=textnos>56</span><br>
They taste not death therein, save the first death. And He hath saved them  from the doom of hell, </P>
<P><A NAME="044_057"><span class=textnos>57</span><br>
A bounty from thy Lord. That is the supreme triumph. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_058"><span class=textnos>58</span><br>
And We have made (this Scripture) easy in thy language only that they may  heed. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_059"><span class=textnos>59</span><br>
Wait then (O Muhammad). Lo! they (too) are waiting. 
</P>
