<P><A NAME="048_001"><span class=textnos>1</span><br>
Lo! We have given thee (O Muhammad) a signal victory, </P>
<P><A NAME="048_002"><span class=textnos>2</span><br>
That Allah may forgive thee of thy sin that which is past and that which is to  come, and may perfect His favour unto thee, and may guide thee on a right path, </P>
<P><A NAME="048_003"><span class=textnos>3</span><br>
And that Allah may help thee with strong help - </P>
<P><A NAME="048_004"><span class=textnos>4</span><br>
He it is Who sent down peace of reassurance into the hearts of the believers  that they might add faith unto their faith. Allah's are the hosts of the heavens and the  earth, and Allah is ever Knower, Wise - </P>
<P><A NAME="048_005"><span class=textnos>5</span><br>
That He may bring the believing men and the believing women into Gardens  underneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide, and may remit from them their  evil deeds -  That, in the sight of Allah, is the supreme triumph - </P>
<P><A NAME="048_006"><span class=textnos>6</span><br>
And may punish the hypocritical men and the hypocritical women, and the  idolatrous men and the idolatrous women, who think an evil thought concerning  Allah. For them is the evil turn of fortune, and Allah is wroth against them and hath  cursed them, and hath made ready for them hell, a hapless journey's end. </P>
<P><A NAME="048_007"><span class=textnos>7</span><br>
Allah's are the hosts of the heavens and the earth, and Allah is ever Mighty,  Wise. </P>
<P><A NAME="048_008"><span class=textnos>8</span><br>
Lo! We have sent thee (O Muhammad) as a witness and a bearer of good  tidings and a warner, </P>
<P><A NAME="048_009"><span class=textnos>9</span><br>
That ye (mankind) may believe in Allah and His messenger, and may honour  Him, and may revere Him, and may glorify Him at early dawn and at the close of day. </P>
<P><A NAME="048_010"><span class=textnos>10</span><br>
Lo! those who swear allegiance unto thee (Muhammad), swear allegiance  only unto Allah. The Hand of Allah is above their hands. So whosoever breaketh his  oath, breaketh it only to his soul's hurt; while whosoever keepeth his covenant with  Allah, on him will He bestow immense reward. </P>
<P><A NAME="048_011"><span class=textnos>11</span><br>
Those of the wandering Arabs who were left behind will tell thee: Our  possessions and our households occupied us, so ask forgiveness for us! They speak  with their tongues that which is not in their hearts. Say: Who can avail you aught  against Allah, if He intend you hurt or intend you profit ? Nay, but Allah is ever  Aware of what ye do. </P>
<P><A NAME="048_012"><span class=textnos>12</span><br>
Nay, but ye deemed that the messenger and the believers would never return  to their own folk, and that was made fairseeming in your hearts, and ye did think an  evil thought, and ye were worthless folk. </P>
<P><A NAME="048_013"><span class=textnos>13</span><br>
And so for him who believeth not in Allah and His messenger - Lo! We have  prepared a flame for disbelievers. </P>

<P><A NAME="048_014"><span class=textnos>14</span><br>
And Allah's is the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth. He forgiveth  whom He will, and punisheth whom He will. And Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful. </P>
<P><A NAME="048_015"><span class=textnos>15</span><br>
Those who were left behind will say, when ye set forth to capture booty: Let  us go with you. They fain would change the verdict of Allah. Say (unto them, O  Muhammad): Ye shall not go with us. Thus hath Allah said beforehand. Then they  will say: Ye are envious of us. Nay, but they understand not, save a little. </P>
<P><A NAME="048_016"><span class=textnos>16</span><br>
Say unto those of the wandering Arabs who were left behind: Ye will be  called against a folk of mighty prowess, to fight them until they surrender; and if ye  obey, Allah will give you a fair reward; but if ye turn away as ye did turn away  before, He will punish you with a painful doom. </P>
<P><A NAME="048_017"><span class=textnos>17</span><br>
There is no blame for the blind, nor is there blame for the lame, nor is there  blame for the sick (that they go not forth to war). And whoso obeyeth Allah and His  messenger, He will make him enter Gardens underneath which rivers flow; and  whoso turneth back, him will He punish with a painful doom. </P>
<P><A NAME="048_018"><span class=textnos>18</span><br>
Allah was well pleased with the believers when they swore allegiance unto  thee beneath the tree, and He knew what was in their hearts, and He sent down peace  of reassurance on them, and hath rewarded them with a near victory; </P>
<P><A NAME="048_019"><span class=textnos>19</span><br>
And much booty that they will capture. Allah is ever Mighty, Wise. </P>
<P><A NAME="048_020"><span class=textnos>20</span><br>
Allah promiseth you much booty that ye will capture, and hath given you this  in advance, and hath withheld men's hands from you, that it may be a token for the  believers, and that He may guide you on a right path. </P>
<P><A NAME="048_021"><span class=textnos>21</span><br>
And other (gain), which ye have not been able to achieve, Allah will  compass it, Allah is Able to do all things. </P>
<P><A NAME="048_022"><span class=textnos>22</span><br>
And if those who disbelieve join battle with you they will take to flight, and  afterward they will find no protecting friend nor helper. </P>
<P><A NAME="048_023"><span class=textnos>23</span><br>
It is the law of Allah which hath taken course aforetime. Thou wilt not find  for the law of Allah aught of power to change. </P>
<P><A NAME="048_024"><span class=textnos>24</span><br>
And He it is Who hath withheld men's hands from you, and hath withheld  your hands from them, in the valley of Mecca, after He had made you victors over  them. Allah is Seer of what ye do. </P>
<P><A NAME="048_025"><span class=textnos>25</span><br>
These it was who disbelieved and debarred you from the Inviolable Place of  Worship, and debarred the offering from reaching its goal. And if it had not been for  believing men and believing women, whom ye know not - lest ye should tread them  under foot and thus incur guilt for them unknowingly; that Allah might bring into His  mercy whom He will - If (the believers and the disbelievers) had been clearly  separated We verily had punished those of them who disbelieved with painful  punishment. </P>
<P><A NAME="048_026"><span class=textnos>26</span><br>
When those who disbelieve had set up in their hearts zealotry, the zealotry of  the Age of Ignorance, then Allah sent down His peace of reassurance upon His  messenger and upon the believers and imposed on them the word of self-restraint, for  they were worthy of it and meet for it. And Allah is Aware of all things. </P>
<P><A NAME="048_027"><span class=textnos>27</span><br>
Allah hath fulfilled the vision for His messenger in very truth. Ye shall  indeed enter the Inviolable Place of Worship, if Allah will, secure, (having your hair)  shaven and cut, not fearing. But He knoweth that which ye know not, and hath given  you a near victory beforehand. </P>
<P><A NAME="048_028"><span class=textnos>28</span><br>
He it is Who hath sent His messenger with the guidance and the religion of  truth, that He may cause it to prevail over all religion. And Allah sufficeth as a  Witness. </P>
<P><A NAME="048_029"><span class=textnos>29</span><br>
Muhammad is the messenger of Allah. And those with him are hard against  the disbelievers and merciful among themselves. Thou (O Muhammad) seest them  bowing and falling prostrate (in worship), seeking bounty from Allah and (His)  acceptance. The mark of them is on their foreheads from the traces of prostration.  Such is their likeness in the Torah and their likeness in the Gospel - like as sown corn  that sendeth forth its shoot and strengtheneth it and riseth firm upon its stalk,  delighting the sowers - that He may enrage the disbelievers with (the sight of) them.  Allah hath promised, unto such of them as believe and do good works, forgiveness  and immense reward. 
</P>
