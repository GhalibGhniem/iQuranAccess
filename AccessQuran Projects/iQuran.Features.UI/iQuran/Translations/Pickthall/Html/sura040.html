<P><A NAME="040_001"><span class=textnos>1</span><br>
Ha. Mim. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_002"><span class=textnos>2</span><br>
The revelation of the Scripture is from Allah, the Mighty, the Knower, </P>
<P><A NAME="040_003"><span class=textnos>3</span><br>
The Forgiver of sin, the Accepter of repentance, the Stern in punishment, the  Bountiful. There is no God save Him. Unto Him is the journeying. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_004"><span class=textnos>4</span><br>
None argue concerning the revelations of Allah save those who disbelieve,  so let not their turn of fortune in the land deceive thee (O Muhammad). </P>
<P><A NAME="040_005"><span class=textnos>5</span><br>
The folk of Noah and the factions after them denied (their messengers)  before these, and every nation purposed to seize their messenger and argued falsely,  (thinking) thereby to refute the Truth. Then I seized them, and how (awful) was My  punishment. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_006"><span class=textnos>6</span><br>
Thus was the word of thy Lord concerning those who disbelieve fulfilled:  That they are owners of the Fire. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_007"><span class=textnos>7</span><br>
Those who bear the Throne, and all who are round about it, hymn the praises  of their Lord and believe in Him and ask forgiveness for those who believe (saying):  Our Lord! Thou comprehendest all things in mercy and knowledge, therefor forgive  those who repent and follow Thy way. Ward off from them the punishment of hell. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_008"><span class=textnos>8</span><br>
Our Lord! And make them enter the Gardens of Eden which thou hast  promised them, with such of their fathers and their wives and their descendants as do  right. Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Mighty, the Wise. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_009"><span class=textnos>9</span><br>
And ward off from them ill-deeds; and he from whom Thou wardest off ill- deeds that day, him verily hast Thou taken into mercy. That is the supreme triumph. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_010"><span class=textnos>10</span><br>
Lo! (on that day) those who disbelieve are informed by proclamation: Verily  Allah's abhorrence is more terrible than your abhorrence one of another, when ye  were called unto the faith but did refuse. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_011"><span class=textnos>11</span><br>
They say: Our Lord! Twice hast Thou made us die, and twice hast Thou  made us live. Now we confess our sins. Is there any way to go out ? </P>
<P><A NAME="040_012"><span class=textnos>12</span><br>
(It is said unto them): This is (your plight) because, when Allah only was  invoked, ye disbelieved, but when some partner was ascribed to Him ye were  believing. But the command belongeth only to Allah, the Sublime, the Majestic. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_013"><span class=textnos>13</span><br>
He it is Who showeth you His portents, and sendeth down for you provision  from the sky. None payeth heed save him who turneth (unto Him) repentant. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_014"><span class=textnos>14</span><br>
Therefor (O believers) pray unto Allah, making religion pure for Him (only),  however much the disbelievers be averse - </P>
<P><A NAME="040_015"><span class=textnos>15</span><br>
The Exalter of Ranks, the Lord of the Throne. He causeth the Spirit of His  command upon whom He will of His slaves, that He may warn of the Day of  Meeting, </P>
<P><A NAME="040_016"><span class=textnos>16</span><br>
The day when they come forth, nothing of them being hidden from Allah.  Whose is the Sovereignty this day ? It is Allah's, the One, the Almighty. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_017"><span class=textnos>17</span><br>
This day is each soul requited that which it hath earned; no wrong (is done)  this day. Lo! Allah is swift at reckoning. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_018"><span class=textnos>18</span><br>
Warn them (O Muhammad) of the Day of the approaching (doom), when the  hearts will be choking the throats, (when) there will be no friend for the wrong-doers,  nor any intercessor who will be heard. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_019"><span class=textnos>19</span><br>
He knoweth the traitor of the eyes, and that which the bosoms hide. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_020"><span class=textnos>20</span><br>
Allah judgeth with truth, while those to whom they cry instead of Him judge  not at all. Lo! Allah, He is the Hearer, the Seer. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_021"><span class=textnos>21</span><br>
Have they not travelled in the land to see the nature of the consequence for  those who disbelieved before them ? They were mightier than these in power and (in  the) traces (which they left behind them) in the earth. Yet Allah seized them for their  sins, and they had no protector from Allah. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_022"><span class=textnos>22</span><br>
That was because their messengers kept bringing them clear proofs (of  Allah's Sovereignty) but they disbelieved; so Allah seized them. Lo! He is Strong,  severe in punishment. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_023"><span class=textnos>23</span><br>
And verily We sent Moses with Our revelations and a clear warrant </P>
<P><A NAME="040_024"><span class=textnos>24</span><br>
Unto Pharaoh and Haman and Korah, but they said: A lying sorcerer! </P>
<P><A NAME="040_025"><span class=textnos>25</span><br>
And when he brought them the Truth from Our presence, they said: Slay the  sons of those who believe with him, and spare their women. But the plot of  disbelievers is in naught but error. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_026"><span class=textnos>26</span><br>
And Pharaoh said: Suffer me to kill Moses, and let him cry unto his Lord.  Lo! I fear that he will alter your religion or that he will cause confusion in the land. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_027"><span class=textnos>27</span><br>
Moses said: Lo! I seek refuge in my Lord and your Lord from every scorner  who believeth not in a Day of Reckoning. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_028"><span class=textnos>28</span><br>
And a believing man of Pharaoh's family, who hid his faith, said: Would ye  kill a man because he saith: My Lord is Allah, and hath brought you clear proofs from  your Lord ? If he is lying, then his lie is upon him; and if he is truthful, then some of  that wherewith he threateneth you will strike you. Lo! Allah guideth not one who is a  prodigal, a liar. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_029"><span class=textnos>29</span><br>
O my people! Yours is the kingdom to-day, ye being uppermost in the land.  But who would save us from the wrath of Allah should it reach us ? Pharaoh said: I  do but show you what I think, and I do but guide you to wise policy. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_030"><span class=textnos>30</span><br>
And he who believed said: O my people! Lo! I fear for you a fate like that of  the factions (of old); </P>
<P><A NAME="040_031"><span class=textnos>31</span><br>
A plight like that of Noah's folk, and A'ad and Thamud, and those after them,  and Allah willeth no injustice for (His) slaves. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_032"><span class=textnos>32</span><br>
And, O my people! Lo! I fear for you a Day of Summoning, </P>
<P><A NAME="040_033"><span class=textnos>33</span><br>
A day when ye will turn to flee, having no preserver from Allah: and he  whom Allah sendeth astray, for him there is no guide. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_034"><span class=textnos>34</span><br>
And verily Joseph brought you of old clear proofs, yet ye ceased not to be in  doubt concerning what he brought you till, when he died, ye said: Allah will not send  any messenger after him. Thus Allah deceiveth him who is a prodigal, a doubter. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_035"><span class=textnos>35</span><br>
Those who wrangle concerning the revelations of Allah without any warrant  that hath come unto them, it is greatly hateful in the sight of Allah and in the sight of  those who believe. Thus doth Allah print on every arrogant, disdainful heart. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_036"><span class=textnos>36</span><br>
And Pharaoh said: O Haman! Build for me a tower that haply I may reach  the roads, </P>
<P><A NAME="040_037"><span class=textnos>37</span><br>
The roads of the heavens, and may look upon the God of Moses, though  verily I think him a liar. Thus was the evil that he did made fairseeming unto Pharaoh,  and he was debarred from the (right) way. The plot of Pharaoh ended but in ruin. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_038"><span class=textnos>38</span><br>
And he who believed said: O my people! Follow me. I will show you the  way of right conduct. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_039"><span class=textnos>39</span><br>
O my people! Lo! this life of the world is but a passing comfort, and lo! the  Hereafter, that is the enduring home. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_040"><span class=textnos>40</span><br>
Whoso doeth an ill-deed, he will be repaid the like thereof, while whoso  doeth right, whether male or female, and is a believer, (all) such will enter the  Garden, where they will be nourished without stint. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_041"><span class=textnos>41</span><br>
And, O my people! What aileth me that I call you unto deliverance when ye  call me unto the Fire ? </P>
<P><A NAME="040_042"><span class=textnos>42</span><br>
Ye call me to disbelieve in Allah and ascribe unto Him as partners that  whereof I have no knowledge, while I call you unto the Mighty, the Forgiver. </P>

<!--#include virtual="/table_middle.txt"-->



<P><A NAME="040_043"><span class=textnos>43</span><br>
Assuredly that whereunto ye call me hath no claim in the world or in the  Hereafter, and our return will be unto Allah, and the prodigals will be owners of the  Fire. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_044"><span class=textnos>44</span><br>
And ye will remember what I say unto you. I confide my cause unto Allah.  Lo! Allah is Seer of (His) slaves. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_045"><span class=textnos>45</span><br>
So Allah warded off from him the evils which they plotted, while a dreadful  doom encompassed Pharaoh's folk, </P>
<P><A NAME="040_046"><span class=textnos>46</span><br>
The Fire; they are exposed to it morning and evening; and on the day when  the Hour upriseth (it is said): Cause Pharaoh's folk to enter the most awful doom. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_047"><span class=textnos>47</span><br>
And when they wrangle in the Fire, the weak say unto those who were proud:  Lo! we were a following unto you; will ye therefor rid us of a portion of the Fire ? </P>
<P><A NAME="040_048"><span class=textnos>48</span><br>
Those who were proud say: Lo! we are all (together) herein. Lo! Allah hath  judged between (His) slaves. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_049"><span class=textnos>49</span><br>
And those in the Fire say unto the guards of hell: Entreat your Lord that He  relieve us of a day of the torment. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_050"><span class=textnos>50</span><br>
They say: Came not your messengers unto you with clear proofs ? They say:  Yea, verily. They say: Then do ye pray, although the prayer of disbelievers is in vain. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_051"><span class=textnos>51</span><br>
Lo! We verily do help Our messengers, and those who believe, in the life of  the world and on the day when the witnesses arise, </P>
<P><A NAME="040_052"><span class=textnos>52</span><br>
The day when their excuse availeth not the evil-doers, and theirs is the curse,  and theirs the ill abode. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_053"><span class=textnos>53</span><br>
And We verily gave Moses the guidance, and We caused the Children of  Israel to inherit the Scripture, </P>
<P><A NAME="040_054"><span class=textnos>54</span><br>
A guide and a reminder for men of understanding. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_055"><span class=textnos>55</span><br>
Then have patience (O Muhammad). Lo! the promise of Allah is true. And  ask forgiveness of thy sin, and hymn the praise of thy Lord at fall of night and in the  early hours. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_056"><span class=textnos>56</span><br>
Lo! those who wrangle concerning the revelations of Allah without a warrant  having come unto them, there is naught else in their breasts save pride which they  will never attain. So take thou refuge in Allah. Lo! He, only He, is the Hearer, the  Seer. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_057"><span class=textnos>57</span><br>
Assuredly the creation of the heavens and the earth is greater than the  creation of mankind; but most of mankind know not. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_058"><span class=textnos>58</span><br>
And the blind man and the seer are not equal, neither are those who believe  and do good works (equal with) the evil-doer. Little do ye reflect! </P>
<P><A NAME="040_059"><span class=textnos>59</span><br>
Lo! the Hour is surely coming, there is no doubt thereof; yet most of  mankind believe not. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_060"><span class=textnos>60</span><br>
And your Lord hath said: Pray unto Me and I will hear your prayer. Lo!  those who scorn My service, they will enter hell, disgraced. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_061"><span class=textnos>61</span><br>
Allah it is Who hath appointed for you night that ye may rest therein, and  day for seeing. Lo! Allah is a Lord of bounty for mankind, yet most of mankind give  not thanks. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_062"><span class=textnos>62</span><br>
Such is Allah, your Lord, the Creator of all things, There is no God save  Him. How then are ye perverted ? </P>
<P><A NAME="040_063"><span class=textnos>63</span><br>
Thus are they perverted who deny the revelations of Allah. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_064"><span class=textnos>64</span><br>
Allah it is Who appointed for you the earth for a dwelling-place and the sky  for a canopy, and fashioned you and perfected your shapes, and hath provided you  with good things. Such is Allah, your Lord. Then blessed be Allah, the Lord of the  Worlds! </P>
<P><A NAME="040_065"><span class=textnos>65</span><br>
He is the Living One. There is no God save Him. So pray unto Him, making  religion pure for Him (only). Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds! </P>
<P><A NAME="040_066"><span class=textnos>66</span><br>
Say (O Muhammad): I am forbidden to worship those unto whom ye cry  beside Allah since there have come unto me clear proofs from my Lord, and I am  commanded to surrender to the Lord of the Worlds. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_067"><span class=textnos>67</span><br>
He it is Who created you from dust, then from a drop (of seed) then from a  clot, then bringeth you forth as a child, then (ordaineth) that ye attain full strength and  afterward that ye become old men - though some among you die before - and that ye  reach an appointed term, that haply ye may understand. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_068"><span class=textnos>68</span><br>
He it is Who quickeneth and giveth death. When He ordaineth a thing, He  saith unto it only: Be! and it is. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_069"><span class=textnos>69</span><br>
Hast thou not seen those who wrangle concerning the revelations of Allah,  how they are turned away ? - </P>
<P><A NAME="040_070"><span class=textnos>70</span><br>
Those who deny the Scripture and that wherewith We send Our messengers.  But they will come to know, </P>
<P><A NAME="040_071"><span class=textnos>71</span><br>
When carcans are about their necks and chains. They are dragged </P>
<P><A NAME="040_072"><span class=textnos>72</span><br>
Through boiling waters; then they are thrust into the Fire. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_073"><span class=textnos>73</span><br>
Then it is said unto them: Where are (all) that ye used to make partners (in  the Sovereignty) </P>
<P><A NAME="040_074"><span class=textnos>74</span><br>
Beside Allah ? They say: They have failed us; but we used not to pray to  anything before. Thus doth Allah send astray the disbelievers (in His guidance). </P>
<P><A NAME="040_075"><span class=textnos>75</span><br>
(And it is said unto them): This is because ye exulted in the earth without  right, and because ye were petulant. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_076"><span class=textnos>76</span><br>
Enter ye the gates of hell, to dwell therein. Evil is the habitation of the  scornful. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_077"><span class=textnos>77</span><br>
Then have patience (O Muhammad). Lo! the promise of Allah is true. And  whether we let thee see a part of that which We promise them, or (whether) We cause  thee to die, still unto Us they will be brought back. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_078"><span class=textnos>78</span><br>
Verily We sent messengers before thee, among them those of whom We  have told thee, and some of whom We have not told thee; and it was not given to any  messenger that he should bring a portent save by Allah's leave, but when Allah's  commandment cometh (the cause) is judged aright, and the followers of vanity will  then be lost. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_079"><span class=textnos>79</span><br>
Allah it is Who hath appointed for you cattle, that ye may ride on some of  them, and eat of some - </P>
<P><A NAME="040_080"><span class=textnos>80</span><br>
(Many) benefits ye have from them - and that ye may satisfy by their means  a need that is in your breasts, and may be borne upon them as upon the ship. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_081"><span class=textnos>81</span><br>
And He showeth you His tokens. Which, then, of the tokens of Allah do ye  deny ? </P>
<P><A NAME="040_082"><span class=textnos>82</span><br>
Have they not travelled in the land to see the nature of the consequence for  those before them ? They were more numerous than these, and mightier in power and  (in the) traces (which they left behind them) in the earth. But all that they used to earn  availed them not. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_083"><span class=textnos>83</span><br>
And when their messengers brought them clear proofs (of Allah's  Sovereignty) they exulted in the knowledge they (themselves) possessed. And that  which they were wont to mock befell them. </P>
<P><A NAME="040_084"><span class=textnos>84</span><br>
Then, when they saw Our doom, they said: We believe in Allah only and  reject (all) that we used to associate (with Him). </P>
<P><A NAME="040_085"><span class=textnos>85</span><br>
But their faith could not avail them when they saw Our doom. This is Allah's  law which hath ever taken course for His bondmen. And then the disbelievers will be  ruined.
