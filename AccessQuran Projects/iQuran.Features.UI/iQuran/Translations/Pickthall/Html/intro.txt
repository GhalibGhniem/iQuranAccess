<b>Introduction:</b>
The Qur'an (also Quran, Koran, Alcoran;) is the Islamic holy book of Allah (Arabic for God).<br><br>


Muslims believe that the Qur'an is the literal word of God, revealed to the Prophet Muhammad over a period of 22 years. The Qur'an consists of 114 suras (chapters) with a total of 6,236 ayats (verses). The Qur'an retells stories of many of the people and events of the Jewish and Christian Bibles, although it differs in many details.
