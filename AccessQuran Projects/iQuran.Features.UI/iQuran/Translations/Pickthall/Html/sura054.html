<P><A NAME="054_001"><span class=textnos>1</span><br>
The hour drew nigh and the moon was rent in twain. </P>
<P><A NAME="054_002"><span class=textnos>2</span><br>
And if they behold a portent they turn away and say: Prolonged illusion. </P>
<P><A NAME="054_003"><span class=textnos>3</span><br>
They denied (the Truth) and followed their own lusts. Yet everything will  come to a decision </P>
<P><A NAME="054_004"><span class=textnos>4</span><br>
And surely there hath come unto them news whereof the purport should  deter, </P>
<P><A NAME="054_005"><span class=textnos>5</span><br>
Effective wisdom; but warnings avail not. </P>
<P><A NAME="054_006"><span class=textnos>6</span><br>
So withdraw from them (O Muhammad) on the day when the Summoner  summoneth unto a painful thing. </P>
<P><A NAME="054_007"><span class=textnos>7</span><br>
With downcast eyes, they come forth from the graves as they were locusts  spread abroad, </P>
<P><A NAME="054_008"><span class=textnos>8</span><br>
Hastening toward the summoner; the disbelievers say: This is a hard day. </P>
<P><A NAME="054_009"><span class=textnos>9</span><br>
The folk of Noah denied before them, yea, they denied Our slave and said: A  madman; and he was repulsed. </P>
<P><A NAME="054_010"><span class=textnos>10</span><br>
So he cried unto his Lord, saying: I am vanquished, so give help. </P>
<P><A NAME="054_011"><span class=textnos>11</span><br>
Then opened We the gates of heaven with pouring water </P>
<P><A NAME="054_012"><span class=textnos>12</span><br>
And caused the earth to gush forth springs, so that the waters met for a  predestined purpose. </P>
<P><A NAME="054_013"><span class=textnos>13</span><br>
And We carried him upon a thing of planks and nails, </P>
<P><A NAME="054_014"><span class=textnos>14</span><br>
That ran (upon the waters) in Our sight, as a reward for him who was  rejected. </P>
<P><A NAME="054_015"><span class=textnos>15</span><br>
And verily We left it as a token; but is there any that remembereth ? </P>
<P><A NAME="054_016"><span class=textnos>16</span><br>
Then see how (dreadful) was My punishment after My warnings! </P>
<P><A NAME="054_017"><span class=textnos>17</span><br>
And in truth We have made the Qur'an easy to remember; but is there any  that remembereth ? </P>
<P><A NAME="054_018"><span class=textnos>18</span><br>
(The tribe of) A'ad rejected warnings. Then how (dreadful) was My  punishment after My warnings. </P>
<P><A NAME="054_019"><span class=textnos>19</span><br>
Lo! We let loose on them a raging wind on a day of constant calamity, </P>
<P><A NAME="054_020"><span class=textnos>20</span><br>
Sweeping men away as though they were uprooted trunks of palm-trees. </P>
<P><A NAME="054_021"><span class=textnos>21</span><br>
Then see how (dreadful) was My punishment after My warnings! </P>
<P><A NAME="054_022"><span class=textnos>22</span><br>
And in truth We have made the Qur'an easy to remember; but is there any  that remembereth ? </P>
<P><A NAME="054_023"><span class=textnos>23</span><br>
(The tribe of) Thamud rejected warnings </P>
<P><A NAME="054_024"><span class=textnos>24</span><br>
For they said; Is it a mortal man, alone among us, that we are to follow ?  Then indeed we should fall into error and madness. </P>
<P><A NAME="054_025"><span class=textnos>25</span><br>
Hath the remembrance been given unto him alone among us ? Nay, but he is  a rash liar. </P>
<P><A NAME="054_026"><span class=textnos>26</span><br>
(Unto their warner it was said): To-morrow they will know who is the rash  liar. </P>
<P><A NAME="054_027"><span class=textnos>27</span><br>
Lo! We are sending the she-camel as a test for them; so watch them and have  patience; </P>

<P><A NAME="054_028"><span class=textnos>28</span><br>
And inform them that the water is to be shared between (her and) them.  Every drinking will be witnessed. </P>
<P><A NAME="054_029"><span class=textnos>29</span><br>
But they call their comrade and he took and hamstrung (her). </P>
<P><A NAME="054_030"><span class=textnos>30</span><br>
Then see how (dreadful) was My punishment after My warnings! </P>
<P><A NAME="054_031"><span class=textnos>31</span><br>
Lo! We sent upon them one Shout, and they became as the dry twigs  (rejected by) the builder of a cattle-fold. </P>
<P><A NAME="054_032"><span class=textnos>32</span><br>
And in truth We have made the Qur'an easy to remember; but is there any  that remembereth ? </P>
<P><A NAME="054_033"><span class=textnos>33</span><br>
The folk of Lot rejected warnings. </P>
<P><A NAME="054_034"><span class=textnos>34</span><br>
Lo! We sent a storm of stones upon them (all) save the family of Lot, whom  We rescued in the last watch of the night, </P>
<P><A NAME="054_035"><span class=textnos>35</span><br>
As grace from Us. Thus We reward him who giveth thanks. </P>
<P><A NAME="054_036"><span class=textnos>36</span><br>
And he indeed had warned them of Our blow, but they did doubt the  warnings. </P>
<P><A NAME="054_037"><span class=textnos>37</span><br>
They even asked of him his guests for an ill purpose. Then We blinded their  eyes (and said): Taste now My punishment after My warnings! </P>
<P><A NAME="054_038"><span class=textnos>38</span><br>
And in truth the punishment decreed befell them early in the morning. </P>
<P><A NAME="054_039"><span class=textnos>39</span><br>
Now taste My punishment after My warnings! </P>
<P><A NAME="054_040"><span class=textnos>40</span><br>
And in truth We have made the Qur'an easy to remember; but is there any  that remembereth ? </P>
<P><A NAME="054_041"><span class=textnos>41</span><br>
And warnings came in truth unto the house of Pharaoh </P>
<P><A NAME="054_042"><span class=textnos>42</span><br>
Who denied Our revelations, every one. Therefore We grasped them with the  grasp of the Mighty, the Powerful. </P>
<P><A NAME="054_043"><span class=textnos>43</span><br>
Are your disbelievers better than those, or have ye some immunity in the  scriptures ? </P>
<P><A NAME="054_044"><span class=textnos>44</span><br>
Or say they: We are a host victorious ? </P>
<P><A NAME="054_045"><span class=textnos>45</span><br>
The hosts will all be routed and will turn and flee. </P>
<P><A NAME="054_046"><span class=textnos>46</span><br>
Nay, but the Hour (of doom) is their appointed tryst, and the Hour will be  more wretched and more bitter (than their earthly failure). </P>
<P><A NAME="054_047"><span class=textnos>47</span><br>
Lo! the guilty are in error and madness. </P>
<P><A NAME="054_048"><span class=textnos>48</span><br>
On the day when they are dragged into the Fire upon their faces (it is said  unto them): Feel the touch of hell. </P>
<P><A NAME="054_049"><span class=textnos>49</span><br>
Lo! We have created every thing by measure. </P>
<P><A NAME="054_050"><span class=textnos>50</span><br>
And Our commandment is but one (commandment), as the twinkling of an  eye. </P>
<P><A NAME="054_051"><span class=textnos>51</span><br>
And verily We have destroyed your fellows; but is there any that  remembereth ? </P>
<P><A NAME="054_052"><span class=textnos>52</span><br>
And every thing they did is in the scriptures, </P>
<P><A NAME="054_053"><span class=textnos>53</span><br>
And every small and great thing is recorded. </P>
<P><A NAME="054_054"><span class=textnos>54</span><br>
Lo! the righteous will dwell among gardens and rivers, </P>
<P><A NAME="054_055"><span class=textnos>55</span><br>
Firmly established in the favour of a Mighty King. 
</P>
