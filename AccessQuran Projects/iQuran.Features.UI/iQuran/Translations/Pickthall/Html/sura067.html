<P><A NAME="067_001"><span class=textnos>1</span><br>
Blessed is He in Whose hand is the Sovereignty, and, He is Able to do all  things. </P>
<P><A NAME="067_002"><span class=textnos>2</span><br>
Who hath created life and death that He may try you which of you is best in  conduct; and He is the Mighty, the Forgiving, </P>
<P><A NAME="067_003"><span class=textnos>3</span><br>
Who hath created seven heavens in harmony. Thou (Muhammad) canst see  no fault in the Beneficent One's creation; then look again: Canst thou see any rifts ? </P>
<P><A NAME="067_004"><span class=textnos>4</span><br>
Then look again and yet again, thy sight will return unto thee weakened and  made dim. </P>
<P><A NAME="067_005"><span class=textnos>5</span><br>
And verily We have beautified the world's heaven with lamps, and We have  made them missiles for the devils, and for them We have prepared the doom of flame. </P>
<P><A NAME="067_006"><span class=textnos>6</span><br>
And for those who disbelieve in their Lord there is the doom of hell, a  hapless journey's end! </P>
<P><A NAME="067_007"><span class=textnos>7</span><br>
When they are flung therein they hear its roaring as it boileth up, </P>
<P><A NAME="067_008"><span class=textnos>8</span><br>
As it would burst with rage. Whenever a (fresh) host is flung therein the  wardens thereof ask them: Came there unto you no warner ? </P>
<P><A NAME="067_009"><span class=textnos>9</span><br>
They say: Yea, verily, a warner came unto us; but we denied and said: Allah  hath naught revealed; ye are in naught but a great error. </P>
<P><A NAME="067_010"><span class=textnos>10</span><br>
And they say: Had we been wont to listen or have sense, we had not been  among the dwellers in the flames. </P>
<P><A NAME="067_011"><span class=textnos>11</span><br>
So they acknowledge their sins; but far removed (from mercy) are the  dwellers in the flames. </P>
<P><A NAME="067_012"><span class=textnos>12</span><br>
Lo! those who fear their Lord in secret, theirs will be forgiveness and a great  reward. </P>
<P><A NAME="067_013"><span class=textnos>13</span><br>
And keep your opinion secret or proclaim it, lo! He is Knower of all that is in  the breasts (of men). </P>
<P><A NAME="067_014"><span class=textnos>14</span><br>
Should He not know what He created ? And He is the Subtile, the Aware. </P>

<P><A NAME="067_015"><span class=textnos>15</span><br>
He it is Who hath made the earth subservient unto you, so Walk in the paths  thereof and eat of His providence. And unto Him will be the resurrection (of the  dead). </P>
<P><A NAME="067_016"><span class=textnos>16</span><br>
Have ye taken security from Him Who is in the heaven that He will not cause  the earth to swallow you when lo! it is convulsed ? </P>
<P><A NAME="067_017"><span class=textnos>17</span><br>
Or have ye taken security from Him Who is in the heaven that He will not let  loose on you a hurricane ? But ye shall know the manner of My warning. </P>
<P><A NAME="067_018"><span class=textnos>18</span><br>
And verily those before them denied, then (see) the manner of My wrath  (with them)! </P>
<P><A NAME="067_019"><span class=textnos>19</span><br>
Have they not seen the birds above them spreading out their wings and  closing them ? Naught upholdeth them save the Beneficent. Lo! He is Seer of all  things. </P>
<P><A NAME="067_020"><span class=textnos>20</span><br>
Or who is he that will be an army unto you to help you instead of the  Beneficent ? The disbelievers are in naught but illusion. </P>
<P><A NAME="067_021"><span class=textnos>21</span><br>
Or who is he that will provide for you if He should withhold His providence  ? Nay, but they are set in pride and frowardness. </P>
<P><A NAME="067_022"><span class=textnos>22</span><br>
Is he who goeth groping on his face more rightly guided, or he who walketh  upright on a straight road ? </P>
<P><A NAME="067_023"><span class=textnos>23</span><br>
Say (unto them, O Muhammad): He it is who gave you being, and hath  assigned unto you ears and eyes and hearts. Small thanks give ye! </P>
<P><A NAME="067_024"><span class=textnos>24</span><br>
Say: He it is Who multiplieth you in the earth, and unto Whom ye will be  gathered. </P>
<P><A NAME="067_025"><span class=textnos>25</span><br>
And they say: When (will) this promise (be fulfilled), if ye are truthful ? </P>
<P><A NAME="067_026"><span class=textnos>26</span><br>
Say: The knowledge is with Allah only, and I am but a plain warner; </P>
<P><A NAME="067_027"><span class=textnos>27</span><br>
But when they see it nigh, the faces of those who disbelieve will be awry,  and it will be said (unto them): This is that for which ye used to call. </P>
<P><A NAME="067_028"><span class=textnos>28</span><br>
Say (O Muhammad): Have ye thought: Whether Allah causeth me  (Muhammad) and those with me to perish or hath mercy on us, still, who will protect  the disbelievers from a painful doom ? </P>
<P><A NAME="067_029"><span class=textnos>29</span><br>
Say: He is the Beneficent. In Him we believe and in Him we put our trust.  And ye will soon know who it is that is in error manifest. </P>
<P><A NAME="067_030"><span class=textnos>30</span><br>
Say: Have ye thought: If (all) your water were to disappear into the earth,  who then could bring you gushing water ? 
</P>
