<P><A NAME="069_001"><span class=textnos>1</span><br>
The Reality! </P>
<P><A NAME="069_002"><span class=textnos>2</span><br>
What is the Reality ? </P>
<P><A NAME="069_003"><span class=textnos>3</span><br>
Ah, what will convey unto thee what the reality is! </P>
<P><A NAME="069_004"><span class=textnos>4</span><br>
(The tribes of) Thamud and A'ad disbelieved in the judgment to come. </P>
<P><A NAME="069_005"><span class=textnos>5</span><br>
As for Thamud, they were destroyed by the lightning. </P>
<P><A NAME="069_006"><span class=textnos>6</span><br>
And as for A'ad, they were destroyed by a fierce roaring wind, </P>
<P><A NAME="069_007"><span class=textnos>7</span><br>
Which He imposed on them for seven long nights and eight long days so that  thou mightest have seen men lying overthrown, as they were hollow trunks of palm- trees. </P>
<P><A NAME="069_008"><span class=textnos>8</span><br>
Canst thou (O Muhammad) see any remnant of them ? </P>
<P><A NAME="069_009"><span class=textnos>9</span><br>
And Pharaoh and those before him, and the communities that were  destroyed, brought error, </P>
<P><A NAME="069_010"><span class=textnos>10</span><br>
And they disobeyed the messenger of their Lord, therefor did He grip them  with a tightening grip. </P>
<P><A NAME="069_011"><span class=textnos>11</span><br>
Lo! when the waters rose, We carried you upon the ship </P>
<P><A NAME="069_012"><span class=textnos>12</span><br>
That We might make it a memorial for you, and that remembering ears (that  heard the story) might remember. </P>
<P><A NAME="069_013"><span class=textnos>13</span><br>
And when the trumpet shall sound one blast </P>
<P><A NAME="069_014"><span class=textnos>14</span><br>
And the earth with the mountains shall be lifted up and crushed with one  crash, </P>
<P><A NAME="069_015"><span class=textnos>15</span><br>
Then, on that day will the Event befall. </P>
<P><A NAME="069_016"><span class=textnos>16</span><br>
And the heaven will split asunder, for that day it will be frail. </P>
<P><A NAME="069_017"><span class=textnos>17</span><br>
And the angels will be on the sides thereof, and eight will uphold the Throne  of thy Lord that day, above them. </P>
<P><A NAME="069_018"><span class=textnos>18</span><br>
On that day ye will be exposed; not a secret of you will be hidden. </P>
<P><A NAME="069_019"><span class=textnos>19</span><br>
Then, as for him who is given his record in his right hand, he will say: Take,  read my book! </P>
<P><A NAME="069_020"><span class=textnos>20</span><br>
Surely I knew that I should have to meet my reckoning. </P>
<P><A NAME="069_021"><span class=textnos>21</span><br>
Then he will be in blissful state </P>
<P><A NAME="069_022"><span class=textnos>22</span><br>
In a high garden </P>
<P><A NAME="069_023"><span class=textnos>23</span><br>
Whereof the clusters are in easy reach. </P>
<P><A NAME="069_024"><span class=textnos>24</span><br>
(And it will be said unto those therein): Eat and drink at ease for that which  ye sent on before you in past days. </P>
<P><A NAME="069_025"><span class=textnos>25</span><br>
But as for him who is given his record in his left hand, he will say: Oh,  would that I had not been given my book </P>
<P><A NAME="069_026"><span class=textnos>26</span><br>
And knew not what my reckoning! </P>
<P><A NAME="069_027"><span class=textnos>27</span><br>
Oh, would that it had been death! </P>
<P><A NAME="069_028"><span class=textnos>28</span><br>
My wealth hath not availed me, </P>

<P><A NAME="069_029"><span class=textnos>29</span><br>
My power hath gone from me. </P>
<P><A NAME="069_030"><span class=textnos>30</span><br>
(It will be said): Take him and fetter him </P>
<P><A NAME="069_031"><span class=textnos>31</span><br>
And then expose him to hell-fire </P>
<P><A NAME="069_032"><span class=textnos>32</span><br>
And then insert him in a chain whereof the length is seventy cubits. </P>
<P><A NAME="069_033"><span class=textnos>33</span><br>
Lo! He used not to believe in Allah the Tremendous, </P>
<P><A NAME="069_034"><span class=textnos>34</span><br>
And urged not on the feeding of the wretched. </P>
<P><A NAME="069_035"><span class=textnos>35</span><br>
Therefor hath he no lover here this day, </P>
<P><A NAME="069_036"><span class=textnos>36</span><br>
Nor any food save filth </P>
<P><A NAME="069_037"><span class=textnos>37</span><br>
Which none but sinners eat. </P>
<P><A NAME="069_038"><span class=textnos>38</span><br>
But nay! I swear by all that ye see </P>
<P><A NAME="069_039"><span class=textnos>39</span><br>
And all that ye see not </P>
<P><A NAME="069_040"><span class=textnos>40</span><br>
That it is indeed the speech of an illustrious messenger. </P>
<P><A NAME="069_041"><span class=textnos>41</span><br>
It is not poet's speech - little is it that ye believe! </P>
<P><A NAME="069_042"><span class=textnos>42</span><br>
Nor diviner's speech - little is it that ye remember! </P>
<P><A NAME="069_043"><span class=textnos>43</span><br>
It is a revelation from the Lord of the Worlds. </P>
<P><A NAME="069_044"><span class=textnos>44</span><br>
And if he had invented false sayings concerning Us, </P>
<P><A NAME="069_045"><span class=textnos>45</span><br>
We assuredly had taken him by the right hand </P>
<P><A NAME="069_046"><span class=textnos>46</span><br>
And then severed his life-artery, </P>
<P><A NAME="069_047"><span class=textnos>47</span><br>
And not one of you could have held Us off from him. </P>
<P><A NAME="069_048"><span class=textnos>48</span><br>
And lo! it is a warrant unto those who ward off (evil). </P>
<P><A NAME="069_049"><span class=textnos>49</span><br>
And lo! We know that some among you will deny (it). </P>
<P><A NAME="069_050"><span class=textnos>50</span><br>
And lo! it is indeed an anguish for the disbelievers. </P>
<P><A NAME="069_051"><span class=textnos>51</span><br>
And lo! it is absolute truth. </P>
<P><A NAME="069_052"><span class=textnos>52</span><br>
So glorify the name of thy Tremendous Lord. 
</P>
