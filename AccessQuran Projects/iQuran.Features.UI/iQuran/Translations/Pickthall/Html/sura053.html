<P><A NAME="053_001"><span class=textnos>1</span><br>
By the Star when it setteth, </P>
<P><A NAME="053_002"><span class=textnos>2</span><br>
Your comrade erreth not, nor is deceived; </P>
<P><A NAME="053_003"><span class=textnos>3</span><br>
Nor doth he speak of (his own) desire. </P>
<P><A NAME="053_004"><span class=textnos>4</span><br>
It is naught save an inspiration that is inspired, </P>
<P><A NAME="053_005"><span class=textnos>5</span><br>
Which one of mighty powers hath taught him, </P>
<P><A NAME="053_006"><span class=textnos>6</span><br>
One vigorous; and he grew clear to view </P>
<P><A NAME="053_007"><span class=textnos>7</span><br>
When he was on the uppermost horizon. </P>
<P><A NAME="053_008"><span class=textnos>8</span><br>
Then he drew nigh and came down </P>
<P><A NAME="053_009"><span class=textnos>9</span><br>
Till he was (distant) two bows' length or even nearer, </P>
<P><A NAME="053_010"><span class=textnos>10</span><br>
And He revealed unto His slave that which He revealed. </P>
<P><A NAME="053_011"><span class=textnos>11</span><br>
The heart lied not (in seeing) what it saw. </P>
<P><A NAME="053_012"><span class=textnos>12</span><br>
Will ye then dispute with him concerning what he seeth ? </P>
<P><A NAME="053_013"><span class=textnos>13</span><br>
And verily he saw him yet another time </P>
<P><A NAME="053_014"><span class=textnos>14</span><br>
By the lote-tree of the utmost boundary, </P>
<P><A NAME="053_015"><span class=textnos>15</span><br>
Nigh unto which is the Garden of Abode. </P>
<P><A NAME="053_016"><span class=textnos>16</span><br>
When that which shroudeth did enshroud the lote-tree, </P>
<P><A NAME="053_017"><span class=textnos>17</span><br>
The eye turned not aside nor yet was overbold. </P>
<P><A NAME="053_018"><span class=textnos>18</span><br>
Verily he saw one of the greater revelations of his Lord. </P>
<P><A NAME="053_019"><span class=textnos>19</span><br>
Have ye thought upon Al-Lat and Al-'Uzza </P>
<P><A NAME="053_020"><span class=textnos>20</span><br>
And Manat, the third, the other ? </P>
<P><A NAME="053_021"><span class=textnos>21</span><br>
Are yours the males and His the females ? </P>
<P><A NAME="053_022"><span class=textnos>22</span><br>
That indeed were an unfair division! </P>
<P><A NAME="053_023"><span class=textnos>23</span><br>
They are but names which ye have named, ye and your fathers, for which  Allah hath revealed no warrant. They follow but a guess and that which (they)  themselves desire. And now the guidance from their Lord hath come unto them. </P>
<P><A NAME="053_024"><span class=textnos>24</span><br>
Or shall man have what he coveteth ? </P>
<P><A NAME="053_025"><span class=textnos>25</span><br>
But unto Allah belongeth the after (life), and the former. </P>
<P><A NAME="053_026"><span class=textnos>26</span><br>
And how many angels are in the heavens whose intercession availeth naught  save after Allah giveth leave to whom He chooseth and accepteth. </P>
<P><A NAME="053_027"><span class=textnos>27</span><br>
Lo! it is those who disbelieve in the Hereafter who name the angels with the  names of females. </P>
<P><A NAME="053_028"><span class=textnos>28</span><br>
And they have no knowledge thereof. They follow but a guess, and lo! a  guess can never take the place of the truth. </P>
<P><A NAME="053_029"><span class=textnos>29</span><br>
Then withdraw (O Muhammad) from him who fleeth from Our remembrance  and desireth but the life of the world. </P>
<P><A NAME="053_030"><span class=textnos>30</span><br>
Such is their sum of knowledge. Lo! thy Lord is Best Aware of him who  strayeth, and He is Best Aware of him whom goeth right. </P>

<P><A NAME="053_031"><span class=textnos>31</span><br>
And unto Allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in  the earth, that He may reward those who do evil with that which they have done, and  reward those who do good with goodness. </P>
<P><A NAME="053_032"><span class=textnos>32</span><br>
Those who avoid enormities of sin and abominations, save the unwilled  offences - (for them) lo! thy Lord is of vast mercy. He is Best Aware of you (from the  time) when He created you from the earth, and when ye were hidden in the bellies of  your mothers. Therefor ascribe not purity unto yourselves. He is Best Aware of him  who wardeth off (evil). </P>
<P><A NAME="053_033"><span class=textnos>33</span><br>
Didst thou (O Muhammad) observe him who turned away, </P>
<P><A NAME="053_034"><span class=textnos>34</span><br>
And gave a little, then was grudging ? </P>
<P><A NAME="053_035"><span class=textnos>35</span><br>
Hath he knowledge of the Unseen so that he seeth ? </P>
<P><A NAME="053_036"><span class=textnos>36</span><br>
Or hath he not had news of what is in the books of Moses </P>
<P><A NAME="053_037"><span class=textnos>37</span><br>
And Abraham who paid his debt: </P>
<P><A NAME="053_038"><span class=textnos>38</span><br>
That no laden one shall bear another's load, </P>
<P><A NAME="053_039"><span class=textnos>39</span><br>
And that man hath only that for which he maketh effort, </P>
<P><A NAME="053_040"><span class=textnos>40</span><br>
And that his effort will be seen. </P>
<P><A NAME="053_041"><span class=textnos>41</span><br>
And afterward he will be repaid for it with fullest payment; </P>
<P><A NAME="053_042"><span class=textnos>42</span><br>
And that thy Lord, He is the goal; </P>
<P><A NAME="053_043"><span class=textnos>43</span><br>
And that He it is who maketh laugh, and maketh weep, </P>
<P><A NAME="053_044"><span class=textnos>44</span><br>
And that He it is Who giveth death and giveth life; </P>
<P><A NAME="053_045"><span class=textnos>45</span><br>
And that He createth the two spouses, the male and the female, </P>
<P><A NAME="053_046"><span class=textnos>46</span><br>
From a drop (of seed) when it is poured forth; </P>
<P><A NAME="053_047"><span class=textnos>47</span><br>
And that He hath ordained the second bringing forth; </P>
<P><A NAME="053_048"><span class=textnos>48</span><br>
And that He it is Who enricheth and contenteth; </P>
<P><A NAME="053_049"><span class=textnos>49</span><br>
And that He it is Who is the Lord of Sirius; </P>
<P><A NAME="053_050"><span class=textnos>50</span><br>
And that He destroyed the former (tribe of) A'ad, </P>
<P><A NAME="053_051"><span class=textnos>51</span><br>
And (the tribe of) Thamud He spared not; </P>
<P><A NAME="053_052"><span class=textnos>52</span><br>
And the folk of Noah aforetime, Lo! they were more unjust and more  rebellious; </P>
<P><A NAME="053_053"><span class=textnos>53</span><br>
And Al-Mu'tafikah He destroyed </P>
<P><A NAME="053_054"><span class=textnos>54</span><br>
So that there covered them that which did cover. </P>
<P><A NAME="053_055"><span class=textnos>55</span><br>
Concerning which then, of the bounties of thy Lord, canst thou dispute ? </P>
<P><A NAME="053_056"><span class=textnos>56</span><br>
This is a warner of the warners of old. </P>
<P><A NAME="053_057"><span class=textnos>57</span><br>
The threatened Hour is nigh. </P>
<P><A NAME="053_058"><span class=textnos>58</span><br>
None beside Allah can disclose it. </P>
<P><A NAME="053_059"><span class=textnos>59</span><br>
Marvel ye then at this statement, </P>
<P><A NAME="053_060"><span class=textnos>60</span><br>
And laugh and not weep, </P>
<P><A NAME="053_061"><span class=textnos>61</span><br>
While ye amuse yourselves ? </P>
<P><A NAME="053_062"><span class=textnos>62</span><br>
Rather prostrate yourselves before Allah and serve Him. 
</P>
