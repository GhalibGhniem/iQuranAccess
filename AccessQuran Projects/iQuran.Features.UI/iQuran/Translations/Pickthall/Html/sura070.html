<P><A NAME="070_001"><span class=textnos>1</span><br>
A questioner questioned concerning the doom about to fall </P>
<P><A NAME="070_002"><span class=textnos>2</span><br>
Upon the disbelievers, which none can repel, </P>
<P><A NAME="070_003"><span class=textnos>3</span><br>
From Allah, Lord of the Ascending Stairways </P>
<P><A NAME="070_004"><span class=textnos>4</span><br>
(Whereby) the angels and the Spirit ascend unto Him in a Day whereof the  span is fifty thousand years. </P>
<P><A NAME="070_005"><span class=textnos>5</span><br>
But be patient (O Muhammad) with a patience fair to see. </P>
<P><A NAME="070_006"><span class=textnos>6</span><br>
Lo! they behold it afar off </P>
<P><A NAME="070_007"><span class=textnos>7</span><br>
While we behold it nigh: </P>
<P><A NAME="070_008"><span class=textnos>8</span><br>
The day when the sky will become as molten copper, </P>
<P><A NAME="070_009"><span class=textnos>9</span><br>
And the hills become as flakes of wool, </P>
<P><A NAME="070_010"><span class=textnos>10</span><br>
And no familiar friend will ask a question of his friend </P>
<P><A NAME="070_011"><span class=textnos>11</span><br>
Though they will be given sight of them. The guilty man will long to be able  to ransom himself from the punishment of that day at the price of his children </P>
<P><A NAME="070_012"><span class=textnos>12</span><br>
And his spouse and his brother </P>
<P><A NAME="070_013"><span class=textnos>13</span><br>
And his kin that harboured him </P>
<P><A NAME="070_014"><span class=textnos>14</span><br>
And all that are in the earth, if then it might deliver him. </P>
<P><A NAME="070_015"><span class=textnos>15</span><br>
But nay! for lo! it is the fire of hell </P>
<P><A NAME="070_016"><span class=textnos>16</span><br>
Eager to roast; </P>
<P><A NAME="070_017"><span class=textnos>17</span><br>
It calleth him who turned and fled (from truth), </P>
<P><A NAME="070_018"><span class=textnos>18</span><br>
And hoarded (wealth) and withheld it. </P>
<P><A NAME="070_019"><span class=textnos>19</span><br>
Lo! man was created anxious, </P>
<P><A NAME="070_020"><span class=textnos>20</span><br>
Fretful when evil befalleth him </P>
<P><A NAME="070_021"><span class=textnos>21</span><br>
And, when good befalleth him, grudging; </P>
<P><A NAME="070_022"><span class=textnos>22</span><br>
Save worshippers. </P>

<P><A NAME="070_023"><span class=textnos>23</span><br>
Who are constant at their worship </P>
<P><A NAME="070_024"><span class=textnos>24</span><br>
And in whose wealth there is a right acknowledged </P>
<P><A NAME="070_025"><span class=textnos>25</span><br>
For the beggar and the destitute; </P>
<P><A NAME="070_026"><span class=textnos>26</span><br>
And those who believe in the Day of Judgment, </P>
<P><A NAME="070_027"><span class=textnos>27</span><br>
And those who are fearful of their Lord's doom - </P>
<P><A NAME="070_028"><span class=textnos>28</span><br>
Lo! the doom of their Lord is that before which none can feel secure - </P>
<P><A NAME="070_029"><span class=textnos>29</span><br>
And those who preserve their chastity </P>
<P><A NAME="070_030"><span class=textnos>30</span><br>
Save with their wives and those whom their right hands possess, for thus  they are not blameworthy; </P>
<P><A NAME="070_031"><span class=textnos>31</span><br>
But whoso seeketh more than that, those are they who are transgressors; </P>
<P><A NAME="070_032"><span class=textnos>32</span><br>
And those who keep their pledges and their covenant, </P>
<P><A NAME="070_033"><span class=textnos>33</span><br>
And those who stand by their testimony </P>
<P><A NAME="070_034"><span class=textnos>34</span><br>
And those who are attentive at their worship. </P>
<P><A NAME="070_035"><span class=textnos>35</span><br>
These will dwell in Gardens, honoured. </P>
<P><A NAME="070_036"><span class=textnos>36</span><br>
What aileth those who disbelieve, that they keep staring toward thee (O  Muhammad), open-eyed, </P>
<P><A NAME="070_037"><span class=textnos>37</span><br>
On the right and on the left, in groups ? </P>
<P><A NAME="070_038"><span class=textnos>38</span><br>
Doth every man among them hope to enter the Garden of Delight ? </P>
<P><A NAME="070_039"><span class=textnos>39</span><br>
Nay, verily. Lo! We created them from what they know. </P>
<P><A NAME="070_040"><span class=textnos>40</span><br>
But nay! I swear by the Lord of the rising-places and the setting-places of the  planets that We verily are Able </P>
<P><A NAME="070_041"><span class=textnos>41</span><br>
To replace them by (others) better than them. And we are not to be outrun. </P>
<P><A NAME="070_042"><span class=textnos>42</span><br>
So let them chat and play until they meet their Day which they are promised, </P>
<P><A NAME="070_043"><span class=textnos>43</span><br>
The day when they come forth from the graves in haste, as racing to a goal, </P>
<P><A NAME="070_044"><span class=textnos>44</span><br>
With eyes aghast, abasement stupefying them: Such is the Day which they  are promised. 
</P>
