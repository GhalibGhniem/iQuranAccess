Qaf. By the Glorious Qur'an, </P>
<P><A NAME="050_002"><span class=textnos>2</span><br>
Nay, but they marvel that a warner of their own hath come unto them; and  the disbelievers say: This is a strange thing: </P>
<P><A NAME="050_003"><span class=textnos>3</span><br>
When we are dead and have become dust (shall we be brought back again) ?  That would be a far return! </P>
<P><A NAME="050_004"><span class=textnos>4</span><br>
We know that which the earth taketh of them, and with Us is a recording  Book. </P>
<P><A NAME="050_005"><span class=textnos>5</span><br>
Nay, but they have denied the truth when it came unto them, therefor they  are now in troubled case. </P>
<P><A NAME="050_006"><span class=textnos>6</span><br>
Have they not then observed the sky above them, how We have constructed  it and beautified it, and how there are no rifts therein ? </P>
<P><A NAME="050_007"><span class=textnos>7</span><br>
And the earth have We spread out, and have flung firm hills therein, and  have caused of every lovely kind to grow thereon, </P>
<P><A NAME="050_008"><span class=textnos>8</span><br>
A vision and a reminder for every penitent slave. </P>
<P><A NAME="050_009"><span class=textnos>9</span><br>
And We send down from the sky blessed water whereby We give growth  unto gardens and the grain of crops, </P>
<P><A NAME="050_010"><span class=textnos>10</span><br>
And lofty date-palms with ranged clusters, </P>
<P><A NAME="050_011"><span class=textnos>11</span><br>
Provision (made) for men; and therewith We quicken a dead land. Even so  will be the resurrection of the dead. </P>
<P><A NAME="050_012"><span class=textnos>12</span><br>
The folk of Noah denied (the truth) before them, and (so did) the dwellers at  Ar-Rass and (the tribe of) Thamud, </P>
<P><A NAME="050_013"><span class=textnos>13</span><br>
And (the tribe of) A'ad, and Pharaoh, and the brethren of Lot, </P>
<P><A NAME="050_014"><span class=textnos>14</span><br>
And the dwellers in the wood, and the folk of Tubb'a: every one denied their  messengers, therefor My threat took effect. </P>
<P><A NAME="050_015"><span class=textnos>15</span><br>
Were We then worn out by the first creation ? Yet they are in doubt about a  new creation. </P>
<P><A NAME="050_016"><span class=textnos>16</span><br>
We verily created man and We know what his soul whispereth to him, and  We are nearer to him than his jugular vein. </P>
<P><A NAME="050_017"><span class=textnos>17</span><br>
When the two Receivers receive (him), seated on the right hand and on the  left, </P>
<P><A NAME="050_018"><span class=textnos>18</span><br>
He uttereth no word but there is with him an observer ready. </P>
<P><A NAME="050_019"><span class=textnos>19</span><br>
And the agony of death cometh in truth. (And it is said unto him): This is that  which thou wast wont to shun. </P>
<P><A NAME="050_020"><span class=textnos>20</span><br>
And the trumpet is blown. This is the threatened Day. </P>
<P><A NAME="050_021"><span class=textnos>21</span><br>
And every soul cometh, along with it a driver and a witness. </P>
<P><A NAME="050_022"><span class=textnos>22</span><br>
(And unto the evil-doer it is said): Thou wast in heedlessness of this. Now  We have removed from thee thy covering, and piercing is thy sight this day. </P>

<P><A NAME="050_023"><span class=textnos>23</span><br>
And (unto the evil-doer) his comrade saith: This is that which I have ready  (as testimony). </P>
<P><A NAME="050_024"><span class=textnos>24</span><br>
(And it is said): Do ye twain hurl to hell each rebel ingrate, </P>
<P><A NAME="050_025"><span class=textnos>25</span><br>
Hinderer of good, transgressor, doubter, </P>
<P><A NAME="050_026"><span class=textnos>26</span><br>
Who setteth up another god along with Allah. Do ye twain hurl him to the  dreadful doom. </P>
<P><A NAME="050_027"><span class=textnos>27</span><br>
His comrade saith: Our Lord! I did not cause him to rebel, but he was  (himself) far gone in error. </P>
<P><A NAME="050_028"><span class=textnos>28</span><br>
He saith: Contend not in My presence, when I had already proffered unto  you the warning. </P>
<P><A NAME="050_029"><span class=textnos>29</span><br>
The sentence that cometh from Me cannot be changed, and I am in no wise a  tyrant unto the slaves. </P>
<P><A NAME="050_030"><span class=textnos>30</span><br>
On the day when We say unto hell: Art thou filled ? and it saith: Can there be  more to come ? </P>
<P><A NAME="050_031"><span class=textnos>31</span><br>
And the Garden is brought nigh for those who kept from evil, no longer  distant. </P>
<P><A NAME="050_032"><span class=textnos>32</span><br>
(And it is said): This is that which ye were promised.  (It is) for every  penitent and heedful one, </P>
<P><A NAME="050_033"><span class=textnos>33</span><br>
Who feareth the Beneficent in secret and cometh with a contrite heart. </P>
<P><A NAME="050_034"><span class=textnos>34</span><br>
Enter it in peace. This is the day of immortality. </P>
<P><A NAME="050_035"><span class=textnos>35</span><br>
There they have all that they desire, and there is more with Us. </P>
<P><A NAME="050_036"><span class=textnos>36</span><br>
And how many a generation We destroyed before them, who were mightier  than these in prowess so that they overran the lands! Had they any place of refuge  (when the judgment came) ? </P>
<P><A NAME="050_037"><span class=textnos>37</span><br>
Lo! therein verily is a reminder for him who hath a heart, or giveth ear with  full intelligence. </P>
<P><A NAME="050_038"><span class=textnos>38</span><br>
And verily We created the heavens and the earth, and all that is between  them, in six Days, and naught of weariness touched Us. </P>
<P><A NAME="050_039"><span class=textnos>39</span><br>
Therefor (O Muhammad) bear with what they say, and hymn the praise of  thy Lord before the rising and before the setting of the sun; </P>
<P><A NAME="050_040"><span class=textnos>40</span><br>
And in the night-time hymn His praise, and after the (prescribed)  prostrations. </P>
<P><A NAME="050_041"><span class=textnos>41</span><br>
And listen on the day when the crier crieth from a near place, </P>
<P><A NAME="050_042"><span class=textnos>42</span><br>
The day when they will hear the (Awful) Cry in truth. That is the day of  coming forth (from the graves). </P>
<P><A NAME="050_043"><span class=textnos>43</span><br>
Lo! We it is Who quicken and give death, and unto Us is the journeying. </P>
<P><A NAME="050_044"><span class=textnos>44</span><br>
On the day when the earth splitteth asunder from them, hastening forth (they  come). That is a gathering easy for Us (to make). </P>
<P><A NAME="050_045"><span class=textnos>45</span><br>
We are Best Aware of what they say, and thou (O Muhammad) art in no wise  a compeller over them. But warn by the Qur'an him who feareth My threat. 
</P>
