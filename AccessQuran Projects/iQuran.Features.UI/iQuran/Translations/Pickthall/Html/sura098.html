<P><A NAME="098_001"><span class=textnos>1</span><br>
Those who disbelieve among the People of the Scripture and the idolaters  could not have left off (erring) till the clear proof came unto them, </P>
<P><A NAME="098_002"><span class=textnos>2</span><br>
A messenger from Allah, reading purified pages </P>
<P><A NAME="098_003"><span class=textnos>3</span><br>
Containing correct scriptures. </P>
<P><A NAME="098_004"><span class=textnos>4</span><br>
Nor were the People of the Scripture divided until after the clear proof came  unto them. </P>
<P><A NAME="098_005"><span class=textnos>5</span><br>
And they are ordered naught else than to serve Allah, keeping religion pure  for Him, as men by nature upright, and to establish worship and to pay the poor-due.  That is true religion. </P>
<P><A NAME="098_006"><span class=textnos>6</span><br>
Lo! those who disbelieve, among the People of the Scripture and the  idolaters, will abide in fire of hell. They are the worst of created beings. </P>
<P><A NAME="098_007"><span class=textnos>7</span><br>
(And) lo! those who believe and do good works are the best of created  beings. </P>
<P><A NAME="098_008"><span class=textnos>8</span><br>
Their reward is with their Lord: Gardens of Eden underneath which rivers  flow, wherein they dwell for ever. Allah hath pleasure in them and they have pleasure  in Him. This is (in store) for him who feareth his Lord. 
</P>
