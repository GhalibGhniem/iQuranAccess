<P><A NAME="036_001"><span class=textnos>1</span><br>
Ya Sin. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_002"><span class=textnos>2</span><br>
By the wise Qur'an, </P>
<P><A NAME="036_003"><span class=textnos>3</span><br>
Lo! thou art of those sent </P>
<P><A NAME="036_004"><span class=textnos>4</span><br>
On a straight path, </P>
<P><A NAME="036_005"><span class=textnos>5</span><br>
A revelation of the Mighty, the Merciful, </P>
<P><A NAME="036_006"><span class=textnos>6</span><br>
That thou mayst warn a folk whose fathers were not warned, so they are  heedless. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_007"><span class=textnos>7</span><br>
Already hath the judgment, (for their infidelity) proved true of most of them,  for they believe not. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_008"><span class=textnos>8</span><br>
Lo! We have put on their necks carcans reaching unto the chins, so that they  are made stiff-necked. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_009"><span class=textnos>9</span><br>
And We have set a bar before them and a bar behind them, and (thus) have  covered them so that they see not. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_010"><span class=textnos>10</span><br>
Whether thou warn them or thou warn them not, it is alike for them, for they  believe not. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_011"><span class=textnos>11</span><br>
Thou warnest only him who followeth the Reminder and feareth the  Beneficent in secret. To him bear tidings of forgiveness and a rich reward. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_012"><span class=textnos>12</span><br>
Lo! We it is Who bring the dead to life. We record that which they send  before (them, and their footprints. And all things We have kept in a clear Register. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_013"><span class=textnos>13</span><br>
Coin for them a similitude: The people of the city when those sent (from  Allah) came unto them; </P>
<P><A NAME="036_014"><span class=textnos>14</span><br>
When We sent unto them twain, and they denied them both, so We  reinforced them with a third, and they said: Lo! we have been sent unto you. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_015"><span class=textnos>15</span><br>
They said: Ye are but mortals like unto us. The Beneficent hath naught  revealed. Ye do but lie! </P>
<P><A NAME="036_016"><span class=textnos>16</span><br>
They answered: Our Lord knoweth that we are indeed sent unto you, </P>
<P><A NAME="036_017"><span class=textnos>17</span><br>
And our duty is but plain conveyance (of the message). </P>
<P><A NAME="036_018"><span class=textnos>18</span><br>
(The people of the city) said: We augur ill of you. If ye desist not, we shall  surely stone you, and grievous torture will befall you at our hands. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_019"><span class=textnos>19</span><br>
They said: Your evil augury be with you! Is it because ye are reminded (of  the truth) ? Nay, but ye are froward folk! </P>
<P><A NAME="036_020"><span class=textnos>20</span><br>
And there came from the uttermost part of the city a man running. He cried:  O my people! Follow those who have been sent! </P>
<P><A NAME="036_021"><span class=textnos>21</span><br>
Follow those who ask of you no fee, and who are rightly guided. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_022"><span class=textnos>22</span><br>
For what cause should I not serve Him Who hath created me, and unto  Whom ye will be brought back ? </P>
<P><A NAME="036_023"><span class=textnos>23</span><br>
Shall I take (other) gods in place of Him when, if the Beneficent should wish  me any harm, their intercession will avail me naught, nor can they save ? </P>
<P><A NAME="036_024"><span class=textnos>24</span><br>
Then truly I should be in error manifest. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_025"><span class=textnos>25</span><br>
Lo! I have believed in your Lord, so hear me! </P>
<P><A NAME="036_026"><span class=textnos>26</span><br>
It was said (unto him): Enter paradise. He said: Would that my people knew </P>
<P><A NAME="036_027"><span class=textnos>27</span><br>
With what (munificence) my Lord hath pardoned me and made me of the  honoured ones! </P>
<P><A NAME="036_028"><span class=textnos>28</span><br>
We sent not down against his people after him a host from heaven, nor do  We ever send. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_029"><span class=textnos>29</span><br>
It was but one Shout, and lo! they were extinct. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_030"><span class=textnos>30</span><br>
Ah, the anguish for the bondmen! Never came there unto them a messenger  but they did mock him! </P>
<P><A NAME="036_031"><span class=textnos>31</span><br>
Have they not seen how many generations We destroyed before them, which  indeed returned not unto them; </P>
<P><A NAME="036_032"><span class=textnos>32</span><br>
But all, without exception, will be brought before Us. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_033"><span class=textnos>33</span><br>
A token unto them is the dead earth. We revive it, and We bring forth from it  grain so that they eat thereof; </P>
<P><A NAME="036_034"><span class=textnos>34</span><br>
And We have placed therein gardens of the date-palm and grapes, and We  have caused springs of water to gush forth therein, </P>
<P><A NAME="036_035"><span class=textnos>35</span><br>
That they may eat of the fruit thereof, and their hands made it not. Will they  not, then, give thanks ? </P>
<P><A NAME="036_036"><span class=textnos>36</span><br>
Glory be to Him Who created all the sexual pairs, of that which the earth  groweth, and of themselves, and of that which they know not! </P>
<P><A NAME="036_037"><span class=textnos>37</span><br>
A token unto them is night. We strip it of the day, and lo! they are in  darkness. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_038"><span class=textnos>38</span><br>
And the sun runneth on unto a resting-place for him. That is the measuring of  the Mighty, the Wise. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_039"><span class=textnos>39</span><br>
And for the moon We have appointed mansions till she return like an old  shrivelled palm-leaf. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_040"><span class=textnos>40</span><br>
It is not for the sun to overtake the moon, nor doth the night outstrip the day.  They float each in an orbit. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_041"><span class=textnos>41</span><br>
And a token unto them is that We bear their offspring in the laden ship, </P>

<!--#include virtual="/table_middle.txt"-->


<P><A NAME="036_042"><span class=textnos>42</span><br>
And have created for them of the like thereof whereon they ride. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_043"><span class=textnos>43</span><br>
And if We will, We drown them, and there is no help for them, neither can  they be saved; </P>
<P><A NAME="036_044"><span class=textnos>44</span><br>
Unless by mercy from Us and as comfort for a while. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_045"><span class=textnos>45</span><br>
When it is said unto them: Beware of that which is before you and that which  is behind you, that haply ye may find mercy (they are heedless). </P>
<P><A NAME="036_046"><span class=textnos>46</span><br>
Never came a token of the tokens of their Lord to them, but they did turn  away from it! </P>
<P><A NAME="036_047"><span class=textnos>47</span><br>
And when it is said unto them: Spend of that wherewith Allah hath provided  you, those who disbelieve say unto those who believe: Shall we feed those whom  Allah, if He willed, would feed ? Ye are in naught else than error manifest. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_048"><span class=textnos>48</span><br>
And they say: When will this promise be fulfilled, if ye are truthful ? </P>
<P><A NAME="036_049"><span class=textnos>49</span><br>
They await but one Shout, which will surprise them while they are disputing. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_050"><span class=textnos>50</span><br>
Then they cannot make bequest, nor can they return to their own folk. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_051"><span class=textnos>51</span><br>
And the trumpet is blown and lo! from the graves they hie unto their Lord, </P>
<P><A NAME="036_052"><span class=textnos>52</span><br>
Crying: Woe upon us! Who hath raised us from our place of sleep ? This is  that which the Beneficent did promise, and the messengers spoke truth. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_053"><span class=textnos>53</span><br>
It is but one Shout, and behold them brought together before Us! </P>
<P><A NAME="036_054"><span class=textnos>54</span><br>
This day no soul is wronged in aught; nor are ye requited aught save what ye  used to do. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_055"><span class=textnos>55</span><br>
Lo! those who merit paradise this day are happily employed, </P>
<P><A NAME="036_056"><span class=textnos>56</span><br>
They and their wives, in pleasant shade, on thrones reclining; </P>
<P><A NAME="036_057"><span class=textnos>57</span><br>
Theirs the fruit (of their good deeds) and theirs (all) that they ask; </P>
<P><A NAME="036_058"><span class=textnos>58</span><br>
The word from a Merciful Lord (for them) is: Peace! </P>
<P><A NAME="036_059"><span class=textnos>59</span><br>
But avaunt ye, O ye guilty, this day! </P>
<P><A NAME="036_060"><span class=textnos>60</span><br>
Did I not charge you, O ye sons of Adam, that ye worship not the devil - Lo!  he is your open foe! - </P>
<P><A NAME="036_061"><span class=textnos>61</span><br>
But that ye worship Me ? That was the right path. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_062"><span class=textnos>62</span><br>
Yet he hath led astray of you a great multitude. Had ye then no sense ? </P>
<P><A NAME="036_063"><span class=textnos>63</span><br>
This is hell which ye were promised (if ye followed him). </P>
<P><A NAME="036_064"><span class=textnos>64</span><br>
Burn therein this day for that ye disbelieved. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_065"><span class=textnos>65</span><br>
This day We seal up their mouths, and their hands speak out to Us and their  feet bear witness as to what they used to earn. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_066"><span class=textnos>66</span><br>
And had We willed, We verily could have quenched their eyesight so that  they should struggle for the way. Then how could they have seen ? </P>
<P><A NAME="036_067"><span class=textnos>67</span><br>
And had We willed, We verily could have fixed them in their place, making  them powerless to go forward or turn back. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_068"><span class=textnos>68</span><br>
He whom we bring unto old age, We reverse him in creation (making him go  back to weakness after strength). Have ye then no sense ? </P>
<P><A NAME="036_069"><span class=textnos>69</span><br>
And We have not taught him (Muhammad) poetry, nor is it meet for him.  This is naught else than a Reminder and a Lecture making plain, </P>
<P><A NAME="036_070"><span class=textnos>70</span><br>
To warn whosoever liveth, and that the word may be fulfilled against the  disbelievers. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_071"><span class=textnos>71</span><br>
Have they not seen how We have created for them of Our handiwork the  cattle, so that they are their owners, </P>
<P><A NAME="036_072"><span class=textnos>72</span><br>
And have subdued them unto them, so that some of them they have for  riding, some for food ? </P>
<P><A NAME="036_073"><span class=textnos>73</span><br>
Benefits and (divers) drinks have they from them. Will they not then give  thanks ? </P>
<P><A NAME="036_074"><span class=textnos>74</span><br>
And they have taken (other) gods beside Allah, in order that they may be  helped. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_075"><span class=textnos>75</span><br>
It is not in their power to help them; but they (the worshippers) are unto them  a host in arms. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_076"><span class=textnos>76</span><br>
So let not their speech grieve thee (O Muhammad). Lo! We know what they  conceal and what proclaim. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_077"><span class=textnos>77</span><br>
Hath not man seen that We have created him from a drop of seed ? Yet lo! he  is an open opponent. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_078"><span class=textnos>78</span><br>
And he hath coined for Us a similitude, and hath forgotten the fact of his  creation, saying: Who will revive these bones when they have rotted away ? </P>
<P><A NAME="036_079"><span class=textnos>79</span><br>
Say: He will revive them Who produced them at the first, for He is Knower  of every creation, </P>
<P><A NAME="036_080"><span class=textnos>80</span><br>
Who hath appointed for you fire from the green tree, and behold! ye kindle  from it. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_081"><span class=textnos>81</span><br>
Is not He Who created the heavens and the earth Able to create the like of  them ? Aye, that He is! for He is the All-Wise Creator, </P>
<P><A NAME="036_082"><span class=textnos>82</span><br>
But His command, when He intendeth a thing, is only that He saith unto it:  Be! and it is. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_083"><span class=textnos>83</span><br>
Therefor Glory be to Him in Whose hand is the dominion over all things!  Unto Him ye will be brought back. 
</P>
