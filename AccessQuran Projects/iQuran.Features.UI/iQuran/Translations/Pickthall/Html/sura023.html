<P><A NAME="023_001"><span class=textnos>1</span><br>
Successful indeed are the believers </P>
<P><A NAME="023_002"><span class=textnos>2</span><br>
Who are humble in their prayers, </P>
<P><A NAME="023_003"><span class=textnos>3</span><br>
And who shun vain conversation, </P>
<P><A NAME="023_004"><span class=textnos>4</span><br>
And who are payers of the poor-due; </P>
<P><A NAME="023_005"><span class=textnos>5</span><br>
And who guard their modesty - </P>
<P><A NAME="023_006"><span class=textnos>6</span><br>
Save from their wives or the (slaves) that their right hands possess, for then  they are not blameworthy, </P>
<P><A NAME="023_007"><span class=textnos>7</span><br>
But whoso craveth beyond that, such are transgressors - </P>
<P><A NAME="023_008"><span class=textnos>8</span><br>
And who are shepherds of their pledge and their covenant, </P>
<P><A NAME="023_009"><span class=textnos>9</span><br>
And who pay heed to their prayers. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_010"><span class=textnos>10</span><br>
These are the heirs </P>
<P><A NAME="023_011"><span class=textnos>11</span><br>
Who will inherit paradise. There they will abide. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_012"><span class=textnos>12</span><br>
Verily We created man from a product of wet earth; </P>
<P><A NAME="023_013"><span class=textnos>13</span><br>
Then placed him as a drop (of seed) in a safe lodging; </P>
<P><A NAME="023_014"><span class=textnos>14</span><br>
Then fashioned We the drop a clot, then fashioned We the clot a little lump,  then fashioned We the little lump bones, then clothed the bones with flesh, and then  produced it as another creation. So blessed be Allah, the Best of creators! </P>
<P><A NAME="023_015"><span class=textnos>15</span><br>
Then lo! after that ye surely die. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_016"><span class=textnos>16</span><br>
Then lo! on the Day of Resurrection ye are raised (again). </P>
<P><A NAME="023_017"><span class=textnos>17</span><br>
And We have created above you seven paths, and We are never unmindful of  creation. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_018"><span class=textnos>18</span><br>
And we send down from the sky water in measure, and We give it lodging in  the earth, and lo! We are Able to withdraw it. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_019"><span class=textnos>19</span><br>
Then We produce for you therewith gardens of date-palms and grapes,  wherein is much fruit for you and whereof ye eat; </P>
<P><A NAME="023_020"><span class=textnos>20</span><br>
And a tree that springeth forth from Mount Sinai that groweth oil and relish  for the eaters. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_021"><span class=textnos>21</span><br>
And lo! in the cattle there is verily a lesson for you. We give you to drink of  that which is in their bellies, and many uses have ye in them, and of them do ye eat; </P>
<P><A NAME="023_022"><span class=textnos>22</span><br>
And on them and on the ship ye are carried. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_023"><span class=textnos>23</span><br>
And We verily sent Noah unto his folk, and he said: O my people! Serve  Allah. Ye have no other God save Him. Will ye not ward off (evil) ? </P>
<P><A NAME="023_024"><span class=textnos>24</span><br>
But the chieftains of his folk, who disbelieved, said: This is only a mortal  like you who would make himself superior to you. Had Allah willed, He surely could  have sent down angels. We heard not of this in the case of our fathers of old. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_025"><span class=textnos>25</span><br>
He is only a man in whom is a madness, so watch him for a while. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_026"><span class=textnos>26</span><br>
He said: My Lord! Help me because they deny me. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_027"><span class=textnos>27</span><br>
Then We inspired in him, saying: Make the ship under Our eyes and Our  inspiration. Then, when Our command cometh and the oven gusheth water, introduce  therein of every (kind) two spouses, and thy household save him thereof against  whom the Word hath already gone forth. And plead not with Me on behalf of those  who have done wrong. Lo! they will be drowned. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_028"><span class=textnos>28</span><br>
And when thou art on board the ship, thou and whoso is with thee, then say:  Praise be to Allah Who hath saved us from the wrongdoing folk! </P>
<P><A NAME="023_029"><span class=textnos>29</span><br>
And say: My Lord! Cause me to land at a blessed landing-place, for Thou art  Best of all who bring to land. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_030"><span class=textnos>30</span><br>
Lo! herein verily are portents, for lo! We are ever putting (mankind) to the  test. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_031"><span class=textnos>31</span><br>
Then, after them, We brought forth another generation; </P>
<P><A NAME="023_032"><span class=textnos>32</span><br>
And we sent among them a messenger of their own, saying: Serve Allah, Ye  have no other God save Him. Will ye not ward off (evil) ? </P>
<P><A NAME="023_033"><span class=textnos>33</span><br>
And the chieftains of his folk, who disbelieved and denied the meeting of the  Hereafter, and whom We had made soft in the life of the world, said: This is only a  mortal like you, who eateth of that whereof ye eat and drinketh of that ye drink. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_034"><span class=textnos>34</span><br>
If ye were to obey a mortal like yourselves, then, lo! ye surely would be  losers. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_035"><span class=textnos>35</span><br>
Doth he promise you that you, when ye are dead and have become dust and  bones, will (again) be brought forth ? </P>
<P><A NAME="023_036"><span class=textnos>36</span><br>
Begone, begone, with that which ye are promised! </P>
<P><A NAME="023_037"><span class=textnos>37</span><br>
There is naught but our life of the world; we die and we live, and we shall  not be raised (again). </P>
<P><A NAME="023_038"><span class=textnos>38</span><br>
He is only a man who hath invented a lie about Allah. We are not going to  put faith in him. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_039"><span class=textnos>39</span><br>
He said: My Lord! Help me because they deny me. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_040"><span class=textnos>40</span><br>
He said: In a little while they surely will become repentant. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_041"><span class=textnos>41</span><br>
So the (Awful) Cry overtook them rightfully, and We made them like as  wreckage (that a torrent hurleth). A far removal for wrongdoing folk! </P>
<P><A NAME="023_042"><span class=textnos>42</span><br>
Then after them We brought forth other generations. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_043"><span class=textnos>43</span><br>
No nation can outstrip its term, nor yet postpone it. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_044"><span class=textnos>44</span><br>
Then We sent our messengers one after another. Whenever its messenger  came unto a nation they denied him; so We caused them to follow one another (to  disaster) and We made them bywords. A far removal for folk who believe not! </P>
<P><A NAME="023_045"><span class=textnos>45</span><br>
Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron with Our tokens and a clear  warrant </P>
<P><A NAME="023_046"><span class=textnos>46</span><br>
Unto Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they scorned (them) and they were despotic  folk. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_047"><span class=textnos>47</span><br>
And they said: Shall we put faith in two mortals like ourselves, and whose  folk are servile unto us ? </P>
<P><A NAME="023_048"><span class=textnos>48</span><br>
So they denied them, and became of those who were destroyed. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_049"><span class=textnos>49</span><br>
And We verily gave Moses the Scripture, that haply they might go aright. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_050"><span class=textnos>50</span><br>
And We made the son of Mary and his mother a portent, and We gave them  refuge on a height, a place of flocks and watersprings. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_051"><span class=textnos>51</span><br>
O ye messengers! Eat of the good things, and do right. Lo! I am Aware of  what ye do. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_052"><span class=textnos>52</span><br>
And lo! this your religion is one religion and I am your Lord, so keep your  duty unto Me. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_053"><span class=textnos>53</span><br>
But they (mankind) have broken their religion among them into sects, each  group rejoicing in its tenets. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_054"><span class=textnos>54</span><br>
So leave them in their error till a time. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_055"><span class=textnos>55</span><br>
Think they that in the wealth and sons wherewith We provide them </P>
<P><A NAME="023_056"><span class=textnos>56</span><br>
We hasten unto them with good things ? Nay, but they perceive not. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_057"><span class=textnos>57</span><br>
Lo! those who go in awe for fear of their Lord. </P>

<!--#include virtual="/table_middle.txt"-->


<P><A NAME="023_058"><span class=textnos>58</span><br>
And those who believe in the revelations of their Lord, </P>
<P><A NAME="023_059"><span class=textnos>59</span><br>
And those who ascribe not partners unto their Lord, </P>
<P><A NAME="023_060"><span class=textnos>60</span><br>
And those who give that which they give with hearts afraid because they are  about to return unto their Lord, </P>
<P><A NAME="023_061"><span class=textnos>61</span><br>
These race for the good things, and they shall win them in the race. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_062"><span class=textnos>62</span><br>
And we task not any soul beyond its scope, and with Us is a Record which  speaketh the truth, and they will not be wronged. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_063"><span class=textnos>63</span><br>
Nay, but their hearts are in ignorance of this (Qur'an), and they have other  works, besides, which they are doing; </P>
<P><A NAME="023_064"><span class=textnos>64</span><br>
Till when We grasp their luxurious ones with the punishment, behold! they  supplicate. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_065"><span class=textnos>65</span><br>
Supplicate not this day! Assuredly ye will not be helped by Us. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_066"><span class=textnos>66</span><br>
My revelations were recited unto you, but ye used to turn back on your heels, </P>
<P><A NAME="023_067"><span class=textnos>67</span><br>
In scorn thereof. Nightly did ye rave together. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_068"><span class=textnos>68</span><br>
Have they not pondered the Word, or hath that come unto them which came  not unto their fathers of old ? </P>
<P><A NAME="023_069"><span class=textnos>69</span><br>
Or know they not their messenger, and so reject him ? </P>
<P><A NAME="023_070"><span class=textnos>70</span><br>
Or say they: There is a madness in him ? Nay, but he bringeth them the  Truth; and most of them are haters of the Truth. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_071"><span class=textnos>71</span><br>
And if the Truth had followed their desires, verily the heavens and the earth  and whosoever is therein had been corrupted. Nay, We have brought them their  Reminder, but from their Reminder they now turn away. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_072"><span class=textnos>72</span><br>
Or dost thou ask of them (O Muhammad) any tribute ? But the bounty of thy  Lord is better, for He is Best of all who make provision. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_073"><span class=textnos>73</span><br>
And lo! thou summonest them indeed unto a straight path. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_074"><span class=textnos>74</span><br>
And lo! those who believe not in the Hereafter are indeed astray from the  path. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_075"><span class=textnos>75</span><br>
Though We had mercy on them and relieved them of the harm afflicting  them, they still would wander blindly on in their contumacy. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_076"><span class=textnos>76</span><br>
Already have We grasped them with punishment, but they humble not  themselves unto their Lord, nor do they pray, </P>
<P><A NAME="023_077"><span class=textnos>77</span><br>
Until, when We open for them the gate of extreme punishment, behold! they  are aghast thereat. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_078"><span class=textnos>78</span><br>
He it is Who hath created for you ears and eyes and hearts. Small thanks give  ye! </P>
<P><A NAME="023_079"><span class=textnos>79</span><br>
And He it is Who hath sown you broadcast in the earth, and unto Him ye will  be gathered. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_080"><span class=textnos>80</span><br>
And He it is Who giveth life and causeth death, and His is the difference of  night and day. Have ye then no sense ? </P>
<P><A NAME="023_081"><span class=textnos>81</span><br>
Nay, but they say the like of that which said the men of old; </P>
<P><A NAME="023_082"><span class=textnos>82</span><br>
They say: When we are dead and have become (mere) dust and bones, shall  we then, forsooth, be raised again ? </P>
<P><A NAME="023_083"><span class=textnos>83</span><br>
We were already promised this, we and our forefathers. Lo! this is naught but  fables of the men of old. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_084"><span class=textnos>84</span><br>
Say: Unto Whom (belongeth) the earth and whosoever is therein, if ye have  knowledge ? </P>
<P><A NAME="023_085"><span class=textnos>85</span><br>
They will say: Unto Allah. Say: Will ye not then remember ? </P>
<P><A NAME="023_086"><span class=textnos>86</span><br>
Say: Who is Lord of the seven heavens, and Lord of the Tremendous Throne  ? </P>
<P><A NAME="023_087"><span class=textnos>87</span><br>
They will say: Unto Allah (all that belongeth). Say: Will ye not then keep  duty (unto Him) ? </P>
<P><A NAME="023_088"><span class=textnos>88</span><br>
Say: In Whose hand is the dominion over all things and He protecteth, while  against Him there is no protection, if ye have knowledge ? </P>
<P><A NAME="023_089"><span class=textnos>89</span><br>
They will say: Unto Allah (all that belongeth). Say: How then are ye  bewitched ? </P>
<P><A NAME="023_090"><span class=textnos>90</span><br>
Nay, but We have brought them the Truth, and lo! they are liars. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_091"><span class=textnos>91</span><br>
Allah hath not chosen any son, nor is there any god along with Him; else  would each god have assuredly championed that which he created, and some of them  would assuredly have overcome others. Glorified be Allah above all that they allege. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_092"><span class=textnos>92</span><br>
Knower of the Invisible and the Visible! and Exalted be He over all that they  ascribe as partners (unto Him)! </P>
<P><A NAME="023_093"><span class=textnos>93</span><br>
Say: My Lord! If Thou shouldst show me that which they are promised. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_094"><span class=textnos>94</span><br>
My Lord! then set me not among the wrongdoing folk. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_095"><span class=textnos>95</span><br>
And verily We are Able to show thee that which We have promised them. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_096"><span class=textnos>96</span><br>
Repel evil with that which is better. We are Best Aware of that which they  allege. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_097"><span class=textnos>97</span><br>
And say: My Lord! I seek refuge in Thee from suggestions of the evil ones, </P>
<P><A NAME="023_098"><span class=textnos>98</span><br>
And I seek refuge in Thee, my Lord, lest they be present with me, </P>
<P><A NAME="023_099"><span class=textnos>99</span><br>
Until, when death cometh unto one of them, he saith: My Lord! Send me  back, </P>
<P><A NAME="023_100"><span class=textnos>100</span><br>
That I may do right in that which I have left behind! But nay! It is but a word  that he speaketh; and behind them is a barrier until the day when they are raised. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_101"><span class=textnos>101</span><br>
And when the trumpet is blown there will be no kinship among them that  day, nor will they ask of one another. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_102"><span class=textnos>102</span><br>
Then those whose scales are heavy, they are the successful. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_103"><span class=textnos>103</span><br>
And those whose scales are light are those who lose their souls, in hell  abiding. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_104"><span class=textnos>104</span><br>
The fire burneth their faces, and they are glum therein. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_105"><span class=textnos>105</span><br>
(It will be said): Were not My revelations recited unto you, and then ye used  to deny them ? </P>
<P><A NAME="023_106"><span class=textnos>106</span><br>
They will say: Our Lord! Our evil fortune conquered us, and we were erring  folk. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_107"><span class=textnos>107</span><br>
Our Lord! Oh, bring us forth from hence! If we return (to evil) then indeed  we shall be wrong-doers. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_108"><span class=textnos>108</span><br>
He saith: Begone therein, and speak not unto Me. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_109"><span class=textnos>109</span><br>
Lo! there was a party of My slaves who said: Our Lord! We believe, therefor  forgive us and have mercy on us for Thou art Best of all who show mercy; </P>
<P><A NAME="023_110"><span class=textnos>110</span><br>
But ye chose them for a laughing-stock until they caused you to forget  remembrance of Me, while ye laughed at them. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_111"><span class=textnos>111</span><br>
Lo! I have rewarded them this day forasmuch as they were steadfast in that  they, even they, are the triumphant. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_112"><span class=textnos>112</span><br>
He will say: How long tarried ye in the earth, counting by years ? </P>
<P><A NAME="023_113"><span class=textnos>113</span><br>
They will say: We tarried by a day or part of a day. Ask of those who keep  count! </P>
<P><A NAME="023_114"><span class=textnos>114</span><br>
He will say: Ye tarried but a little if ye only knew. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_115"><span class=textnos>115</span><br>
Deemed ye then that We had created you for naught, and that ye would not  be returned unto Us ? </P>
<P><A NAME="023_116"><span class=textnos>116</span><br>
Now Allah be Exalted, the True King! There is no God save Him, the Lord  of the Throne of Grace. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_117"><span class=textnos>117</span><br>
He who crieth unto any other god along with Allah hath no proof thereof. His  reckoning is only with his Lord. Lo! disbelievers will not be successful. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_118"><span class=textnos>118</span><br>
And (O Muhammad) say: My Lord! Forgive and have mercy, for Thou art  Best of all who show mercy. 
</P>
