<P><A NAME="071_001"><span class=textnos>1</span><br>
Lo! We sent Noah unto his people (saying): Warn thy people ere the painful  doom come unto them. </P>
<P><A NAME="071_002"><span class=textnos>2</span><br>
He said: O my people! Lo! I am a plain warner unto you </P>
<P><A NAME="071_003"><span class=textnos>3</span><br>
(Bidding you): Serve Allah and keep your duty unto Him and obey me, </P>
<P><A NAME="071_004"><span class=textnos>4</span><br>
That He may forgive you somewhat of your sins and respite you to an  appointed term. Lo! the term of Allah, when it cometh, cannot be delayed, if ye but  knew. </P>
<P><A NAME="071_005"><span class=textnos>5</span><br>
He said: My Lord! Lo! I have called unto my people night and day </P>
<P><A NAME="071_006"><span class=textnos>6</span><br>
But all my calling doth but add to their repugnance; </P>
<P><A NAME="071_007"><span class=textnos>7</span><br>
And lo! whenever I call unto them that Thou mayst pardon them they thrust  their fingers in their ears and cover themselves with their garments and persist (in  their refusal) and magnify themselves in pride. </P>
<P><A NAME="071_008"><span class=textnos>8</span><br>
And lo! I have called unto them aloud, </P>
<P><A NAME="071_009"><span class=textnos>9</span><br>
And lo! I have made public proclamation unto them, and I have appealed to  them in private. </P>
<P><A NAME="071_010"><span class=textnos>10</span><br>
And I have said: Seek pardon of your Lord. Lo! He was ever Forgiving. </P>
<P><A NAME="071_011"><span class=textnos>11</span><br>
He will let loose the sky for you in plenteous rain, </P>
<P><A NAME="071_012"><span class=textnos>12</span><br>
And will help you with wealth and sons, and will assign unto you Gardens  and will assign unto you rivers. </P>
<P><A NAME="071_013"><span class=textnos>13</span><br>
What aileth you that ye hope not toward Allah for dignity </P>
<P><A NAME="071_014"><span class=textnos>14</span><br>
When He created you by (divers) stages ? </P>

<P><A NAME="071_015"><span class=textnos>15</span><br>
See ye not how Allah hath created seven heavens in harmony, </P>
<P><A NAME="071_016"><span class=textnos>16</span><br>
And hath made the moon a light therein, and made the sun a lamp ? </P>
<P><A NAME="071_017"><span class=textnos>17</span><br>
And Allah hath caused you to grow as a growth from the earth, </P>
<P><A NAME="071_018"><span class=textnos>18</span><br>
And afterward He maketh you return thereto, and He will bring you forth  again, a (new) forthbringing. </P>
<P><A NAME="071_019"><span class=textnos>19</span><br>
And Allah hath made the earth a wide expanse for you </P>
<P><A NAME="071_020"><span class=textnos>20</span><br>
That ye may thread the valley-ways thereof. </P>
<P><A NAME="071_021"><span class=textnos>21</span><br>
Noah said: My Lord! Lo! they have disobeyed me and followed one whose  wealth and children increase him in naught save ruin; </P>
<P><A NAME="071_022"><span class=textnos>22</span><br>
And they have plotted a mighty plot, </P>
<P><A NAME="071_023"><span class=textnos>23</span><br>
And they have said: Forsake not your gods. Forsake not Wadd, nor Suwa',  nor Yaghuth and Ya'uq and Nasr. </P>
<P><A NAME="071_024"><span class=textnos>24</span><br>
And they have led many astray, and Thou increasest the wrong-doers in  naught save error. </P>
<P><A NAME="071_025"><span class=textnos>25</span><br>
Because of their sins they were drowned, then made to enter a Fire. And they  found they had no helpers in place of Allah. </P>
<P><A NAME="071_026"><span class=textnos>26</span><br>
And Noah said: My Lord! Leave not one of the disbelievers in the land. </P>
<P><A NAME="071_027"><span class=textnos>27</span><br>
If Thou shouldst leave them, they will mislead Thy slaves and will beget  none save lewd ingrates. </P>
<P><A NAME="071_028"><span class=textnos>28</span><br>
My Lord! Forgive me and my parents and him who entereth my house  believing, and believing men and believing women, and increase not the wrong-doers  in aught save ruin. 
</P>
